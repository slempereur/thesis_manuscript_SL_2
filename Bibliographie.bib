abstract = {We describe a series of stages for development of the embryo of the zebrafish, Danio (Brachydanio) rerio. We define seven broad periods of embryogenesis--the zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching periods. These divisions highlight the changing spectrum of major developmental processes that occur during the first 3 days after fertilization, and we review some of what is known about morphogenesis and other significant events that occur during each of the periods. Stages subdivide the periods. Stages are named, not numbered as in most other series, providing for flexibility and continued evolution of the staging series as we learn more about development in this species. The stages, and their names, are based on morphological features, generally readily identified by examination of the live embryo with the dissecting stereomicroscope. The descriptions also fully utilize the optical transparancy of the live embryo, which provides for visibility of even very deep structures when the embryo is examined with the compound microscope and Nomarski interference contrast illumination. Photomicrographs and composite camera lucida line drawings characterize the stages pictorially. Other figures chart the development of distinctive characters used as staging aid signposts.}

Here we use light-sheet microscopy to record activity, reported through the genetically encoded calcium indicator {GCaMP5G}, from the entire volume of the brain of the larval zebrafish in vivo at 0.8 Hz, capturing more than 80\% of all neurons at single-cell resolution. Demonstrating how this technique can be used to reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an anatomically symmetric population in the anterior hindbrain, with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow oscillations in the inferior olive.}

When applied to degenerating neurons, {iDISCO} revealed unexpected variability in number of apoptotic neurons within individual sensory ganglia despite tight control of total number in all ganglia.

Here we describe protocols spanning multiple dimensions of the {CLARITY} workflow, ranging from simple, reliable and efficient lipid removal without electrophoretic instrumentation (passive {CLARITY}) to optimized objectives and integration with light-sheet optics ({CLARITY}-optimized light-sheet microscopy ({COLM})) for accelerating data collection from clarified samples by several orders of magnitude while maintaining or increasing quality and resolution. The entire protocol takes from 7-28 d to complete for an adult mouse brain, including hydrogel embedding, full lipid removal, whole-brain antibody staining (which, if needed, accounts for 7-10 of the days), and whole-brain high-resolution imaging; timing within this window depends on the choice of lipid removal options, on the size of the tissue, and on the number and type of immunostaining rounds performed. This protocol has been successfully applied to the study of adult mouse, adult zebrafish and adult human brains, and it may find many other applications in the structural and molecular analysis of large assembled biological systems.}

abstract = {Zebrafish have become a popular organism for the study of vertebrate gene function. The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that approximately 70\% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.}

The zebrafish is an excellent model to study specific regulators of vascular development, yet the role of {PDGF} signaling has not been determined in early zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, vascular mural cells, in which {PDGFRbeta} functions cell autonomously in other systems, have not been identified in zebrafish embryos younger than 72 hours post fertilization. {METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: In order to investigate the role of {PDGFRbeta} in zebrafish vascular development, we cloned the highly conserved zebrafish homolog of {PDGFRbeta}. We found that pdgfrbeta is expressed in the hypochord, a developmental structure that is immediately dorsal to the dorsal aorta and potentially regulates blood vessel development in the zebrafish. Using a {PDGFR} tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a morpholino oligonucleotide specific to {PDGFRbeta}, and a dominant negative {PDGFRbeta} transgenic line, we found that {PDGFRbeta} is necessary for angiogenesis of the intersegmental vessels. {SIGNIFICANCE}/{CONCLUSION}: Our data provide the first evidence that {PDGFRbeta} signaling is required for zebrafish angiogenesis. We propose a novel mechanism for zebrafish {PDGFRbeta} signaling that regulates vascular angiogenesis in the absence of mural cells.}

These induced neuronal cells acquire the ability of repetitive action potential firing and serve as synaptic targets for other neurons, indicating their capability of integrating into neural networks. Genetic fate-mapping in mice expressing an inducible Cre recombinase under the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase promoter corroborated the pericytic origin of the reprogrammed cells.

abstract = {The zebrafish is a useful model for understanding normal and cancer stem cells, but analysis has been limited to embryogenesis due to the opacity of the adult fish. To address this, we have created a transparent adult zebrafish in which we transplanted either hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells or tumor cells. In a hematopoiesis radiation recovery assay, transplantation of {GFP}-labeled marrow cells allowed for striking in vivo visual assessment of engraftment from 2 hr-5 weeks posttransplant. Using {FACS} analysis, both transparent and wild-type fish had equal engraftment, but this could only be visualized in the transparent recipient. In a tumor engraftment model, transplantation of {RAS}-melanoma cells allowed for visualization of tumor engraftment, proliferation, and distant metastases in as little as 5 days, which is not seen in wild-type recipients until 3 to 4 weeks. This transparent adult zebrafish serves as the ideal combination of both sensitivity and resolution for in vivo stem cell analyses.}

The resulting two images are computationally fused yielding a superior image. The effective light sheet is thinner, and the axial resolution is increased by square root 2 over single-directional {SPIM}. The multidirectional illumination proves essential in biological specimens such as millimeter-sized embryos. The performance of {mSPIM} is demonstrated by the imaging of live zebrafish embryos.}

However, there is increasing evidence that the fetal meninges play important roles during brain development. Through the release of diffusible factors, the meninges influence the proliferative and migratory behaviors of neural progenitors and neurons in the forebrain and hindbrain. Meningeal cells also secrete and organize the pial basement membrane ({BM}), a critical anchor point for the radially oriented fibers of neuroepithelial stem cells. With its emerging role in brain development, the potential that defects in meningeal development may underlie certain congenital brain abnormalities in humans should be considered. In this review, we will discuss what is known about assembly of the fetal meninges and review the role of meningeal-derived proteins in mouse and human brain development.

Only two amphibian neoplasms, the renal adenocarcinoma of Rana pipiens and the lymphosarcoma of Xenopus laevis, have been extensively explored. Amphibians are resistant to the development of neoplasia, even following exposure to "direct-acting" chemical carcinogens such as N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, that are highly lymphotoxic, thus diminishing immune reactivity. Regenerative capacity in adults, and a dramatic metamorphosis which remodels much of the larval body to produce the adult form, are unique to amphibian vertebrates, and the control mechanisms involved may protect against cancer. For example, naturally rising corticosteroid titres during metamorphosis will impair some T-cell functions, and the removal of T-regulatory (suppressor) functions inhibits the induction of altered-self tolerance. Altered-self tolerance is not as effectively induced in adult Xenopus laevis as in mammals, so cancer cells with new antigenicity are more likely be rejected in amphibians. Amphibian immunocytes tend to undergo apoptosis readily in vitro, and, unlike mammalian immunocytes, undergo apoptosis without entering the cell cycle. Cells not in the cell cycle that die from nuclear damage (apoptosis), will have no opportunity to express genetic instability leading to cell transformation. We suggest that all these factors, rather than any one of them, may reduce susceptibility to cancer in amphibians.}

In this screen, 7-day-old parthenogenetic half-tetrad larvae from potential carrier females were screened for mutations affecting cell differentiation in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections. Seven, noncomplementing, recessive mutations were found. Two mutations affect only the retina: segmented photoreceptors (spr) show a discontinuous photoreceptor cell layer; vestigial outer segments (vos) has fewer photoreceptor cells and degenerated outer segments within this cell layer. Three mutants have gut-specific defects: the epithelial cells of kirby (kby) are replaced by ballooned cells; the intestines of stuffy (sfy) and stuffed (sfd) contain increased luminal mucus. Two mutations affect multiple organs: disordered neural retina (dnr) has disrupted retinal layering and mild nuclear abnormalities in the gut and liver; and in huli hutu (hht), the retinal cell layers are disorganized and multiple organs have mild to severe nuclear abnormalities that are reminiscent of the atypia of human neoplasia. Each mutation appears to be homozygous lethal. This screen is proof of principle for the feasibility of histologic screens to yield novel mutations, including potential models of human disease. The throughput for this type of screen may be enhanced by automation. Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}

Therefore, alpha1 tubulin gene expression may serve as a good probe for mechanisms underlying {CNS} development and regeneration. One approach to identify these mechanisms is to work backwards from the genome. This requires identification of alpha1 tubulin {DNA} sequences that mediate its developmental and regeneration-dependent expression pattern. Therefore, we generated transgenic zebrafish harboring a fragment of the alpha1 tubulin gene driving green fluorescent protein expression ({GFP}). In these fish, and similar to the endogenous gene, transgene expression was dramatically induced in the developing and regenerating nervous system. Although transgene expression generally declined during maturation of the nervous system, robust {GFP} expression was maintained in progenitor cells in the retinal periphery, lining brain ventricles and surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. When these cells were cultured in vitro they divided and gave rise to new neurons. We also show that optic nerve crush in adult fish re-induced transgene expression in retinal ganglion cells. These studies identified a relatively small region of the alpha1 tubulin promoter that mediates its regulated expression pattern in developing and adult fish. This promoter will be extremely useful to investigators interested in targeting gene expression to the developing or regenerating nervous system. As adult transgenic fish maintain transgene expression in neural progenitors, these fish also provide a valuable resource of labeled adult neural progenitor cells that can be studied in vivo or in vitro. Finally, these fish should provide a unique in vivo system for investigating mechanisms mediating {CNS} development and regeneration.}

abstract = {The zebrafish (Danio rerio)/tumor xenograft model represents a powerful new model system in cancer. Here, we describe a novel exploitation of the zebrafish model to investigate tumor angiogenesis, a pivotal step in cancer progression and target for antitumor therapies. Human and murine tumor cell lines that express the angiogenic fibroblast growth factor ({FGF}) 2 and/or vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) induce the rapid formation of a new microvasculature when grafted close to the developing subintestinal vessels of zebrafish embryos at 48 h postfertilization. Instead, no angiogenic response was exerted by related cell clones defective in the production of these angiogenic growth factors. The newly formed blood vessels sprout from the subintestinal plexus of the zebrafish embryo, penetrate the tumor graft, and express the transcripts for the zebrafish orthologues of the early endothelial markers Fli-1, {VEGF} receptor-2 ({VEGFR2}/{KDR}), and {VE}-cadherin. Accordingly, green fluorescent protein-positive neovessels infiltrate the graft when tumor cells are injected in transgenic {VEGFR2}:G-{RCFP} zebrafish embryos that express green fluorescent protein under the control of the {VEGFR2}/{KDR} promoter. Systemic exposure of zebrafish embryos immediately after tumor cell injection to prototypic antiangiogenic inhibitors, including the {FGF} receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor {SU5402} and the {VEGFR2}/{KDR} tyrosine kinase inhibitor {SU5416}, suppresses tumor-induced angiogenesis without affecting normal blood vessel development. Accordingly, {VE}-cadherin gene inactivation by antisense morpholino oligonucleotide injection inhibits tumor neovascularization without affecting the development of intersegmental and subintestinal vessels. These data show that the zebrafish/tumor xenograft model represents a novel tool for investigating the neovascularization process exploitable for drug discovery and gene targeting in tumor angiogenesis.}

abstract = {Neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus ({DG}) of the hippocampus occurs constitutively throughout postnatal life, and the rate of neurogenesis within the {DG} can be altered under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Adult neurogenesis includes the process in which the division of a precursor cell takes place and the multi-step process (proliferation, differentiation, migration, targeting, and synaptic integration) that ends with the formation of a postmitotic functionally integrated new neuron. During specific time-frames of adult neurogenesis, various markers are expressed that correlate with the differentiation steps along the pathway from early progenitor cells to newly generated postmitotic neurons within the {DG}. Markers that are currently widely used for the investigation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are: glial fibrillary acidic protein, nestin, Pax6, {NeuroD}, {PSA}-{NCAM}, doublecortin, {TUC}-4, Tuj-1, and calretinin. The discovery and development of specific markers that allow the time-course and fate of neurons to be followed during adult neurogenesis in a detailed and precise fashion are not only helpful for gaining further insights into the genesis of new neurons in the hippocampus, but also might be applicable to the development of strategies for therapeutic interventions.}

Mutations in seven genes cause loss of one or both otoliths, but do not appear to affect development of other structures within the ear. Mutations in seven genes affect morphology and patterning of the inner ear epithelium, including formation of the semicircular canals and, in some, development of sensory patches (maculae and cristae). Within this class, dog-eared mutants show abnormal development of semicircular canals and lack cristae within the ear, while in van gogh, semicircular canals fail to form altogether, resulting in a tiny otic vesicle containing a single sensory patch. Both these mutants show defects in the expression of homeobox genes within the otic vesicle. In a further class of mutants, ear size is affected while patterning appears to be relatively normal; mutations in three genes cause expansion of the otic vesicle, while in little ears and microtic, the ear is abnormally small, but still contains all five sensory patches, as in the wild type. Many of the ear and otolith mutants show an expected behavioural phenotype: embryos fail to balance correctly, and may swim on their sides, upside down, or in circles. Several mutants with similar balance defects have also been isolated that have no obvious structural ear defect, but that may include mutants with vestibular dysfunction of the inner ear (Granato, M., van Eeden, F. J. M., Schach, U. et al. (1996) Development, 123, 399-413,). Mutations in 19 genes causing primary defects in other structures also show an ear defect. In particular, ear phenotypes are often found in conjunction with defects of neural crest derivatives (pigment cells and/or cartilaginous elements of the jaw). At least one mutant, dog-eared, shows defects in both the ear and another placodally derived sensory system, the lateral line, while hypersensitive mutants have additional trunk lateral line organs.}

Three varying types of lesion measurements were performed by five readers on each study by using {DCE} {MR} imaging perfusion analysis software with manual {ROI} placement and a semiautomatic lesion segmentation and histogram analysis solution. Intra- and interreader variability of measurements of K(trans) with the different measurement types was calculated. {RESULTS}: The overall interobserver variability of K(trans) with manual {ROI} placement (mean, 28.5\% ± 9.3) was reduced by 42.5\% when the semiautomatic, software-assisted lesion measurement method was used (16.4\% ± 6.2). Whole-lesion measurement showed the lowest interobserver variability with both measurement methods (20.1\% ± 4.3 with the manual method vs 10.8\% ± 2.6 with the semiautomatic method). The overall intrareader variability with the manual {ROI} method (7.6\% ± 10.6) was not significantly different from that with the semiautomatic method (7.3\% ± 10.8), but the intraclass correlation coefficient for intrareader reproducibility improved from 0.86 overall with the manual method to 0.99 with the semiautomatic method. {CONCLUSION}: A semiautomatic lesion segmentation and histogram analysis approach can provide a significant reduction in interobserver variability for {DCE} {MR} imaging measurements of K(trans) when compared with manual {ROI} methods, whereas intraobserver reproducibility is improved to some extent.}

From the utility of the egg and oocyte extract system to the use of whole embryos as developmental or induced tumour models, the Xenopus system has been fundamental to investigation of cell cycle mechanisms, cell metabolism, cell signalling and cell behaviour, and has allowed an increasing appreciation of the parallels between early development and the pathogenesis of tumour progression and metastasis.

We introduce a pipeline for high-speed acquisition of brain activity at cellular resolution through profiling immediate early gene expression using immunostaining and light-sheet fluorescence imaging, followed by automated mapping and analysis of activity by an open-source software program we term {ClearMap}. We validate the pipeline first by analysis of brain regions activated in response to haloperidol. Next, we report new cortical regions downstream of whisker-evoked sensory processing during active exploration. Last, we combine activity mapping with axon tracing to uncover new brain regions differentially activated during parenting behavior. This pipeline is widely applicable to different experimental paradigms, including animal species for which transgenic activity reporters are not readily available.

Here we describe a detailed protocol for constructing {ZFN} expression vectors, for generating and introducing {ZFN}-encoding {RNAs} into zebrafish embryos and for identifying {ZFN}-generated mutations in targeted genomic sites.

Here we gathered and generalized a series of {NSC} biomarkers emerging during the procedures of embryonic and adult neural stem cell, which may be used to identify the subpopulation cells with distinguishing characters in different timeframes of neurogenesis. The identifications of cell patterns will provide applications to the detailed investigations of diverse developmental cell stages and the extents of cell differentiation, which will facilitate the tracing of cell time-course and fate determination of specific cell types and promote the further and literal discoveries of embryonic and adult neurogenesis.

Due to the spur of interest in zebrafish research, the need to establish and maintain a productive zebrafish housing facility is also increasing. Although literature is available for the maintenance of a zebrafish laboratory, a concise video protocol is lacking. This video illustrates the protocol for regular housing, feeding, breeding and raising of zebrafish larvae. This process will help researchers to understand the natural behaviour and optimal conditions of zebrafish husbandry and hence troubleshoot experimental issues that originate from the fish husbandry conditions. This protocol will be of immense help to researchers planning to establish a zebrafish laboratory, and also to graduate students who are intending to use zebrafish as an animal model.}

abstract = {The larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent vertebrate model for in vivo imaging of biological phenomena at subcellular, cellular and systems levels. However, the optical accessibility of highly pigmented tissues, like the eyes, is limited even in this animal model. Typical strategies to improve the transparency of zebrafish larvae require the use of either highly toxic chemical compounds (e.g. 1-phenyl-2-thiourea, {PTU}) or pigmentation mutant strains (e.g. casper mutant). To date none of these strategies produce normally behaving larvae that are transparent in both the body and the eyes. Here we present crystal, an optically clear zebrafish mutant obtained by combining different viable mutations affecting skin pigmentation. Compared to the previously described combinatorial mutant casper, the crystal mutant lacks pigmentation also in the retinal pigment epithelium, therefore enabling optical access to the eyes. Unlike {PTU}-treated animals, crystal larvae are able to perform visually guided behaviours, such as the optomotor response, as efficiently as wild type larvae. To validate the in vivo application of crystal larvae, we performed whole-brain light-sheet imaging and two-photon calcium imaging of neural activity in the retina. In conclusion, this novel combinatorial pigmentation mutant represents an ideal vertebrate tool for completely unobstructed structural and functional in vivo investigations of biological processes, particularly when imaging tissues inside or between the eyes.}

Recent advances in tissue-clearing technology have enabled rapid and comprehensive cellular analyses in whole organs and in the whole body by a combination of state-of-the-art technologies of optical imaging and image informatics. In this review, we focus mainly on the chemical principles in currently available techniques for tissue clearing and staining to facilitate our understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Tissue clearing is usually conducted by the following steps: (a) fixation, (b) permeabilization, (c) decolorizing, and (d) refractive index ({RI}) matching. To phenotype individual cells after tissue clearing, it is important to visualize genetically encoded fluorescent reporters and/or to stain tissues with fluorescent dyes, fluorescent labeled antibodies, or nucleic acid probes. Although some technical challenges remain, the chemical principles in tissue clearing and staining for {WBC} profiling will enable various applications, such as identifying cellular circuits across multiple organs and measuring their dynamics in stochastic and proliferative cellular processes, for example, autoimmune and malignant neoplastic diseases.}

Present knowledge indicates that all vertebrates have brain barrier membranes and, further, that functional characteristics of these membranes are basically similar in all the vertebrate classes. The blood-brain barrier (or capillary-glial complex) and the meningeal barrier have many of the properties of a tight epithelium, including the presence of tight junctions and specific transport mechanisms. The choroidal epithelium is a typical secretory epithelium. The functional significance of the specialized membranes located at the blood-brain interface is considered, and we suggest that the phylogenetic development of a blood-brain barrier provided neurons of the vertebrate brain with a unique extracellular milieu optimal both for synaptic communication and for nonsynaptic communication via the entire extracellular space.}

While there are many genetic and environmental factors that affect these entities through a heterogeneous group of disease processes, the ultimate final pathologic insult in humans is defined as a stroke, or damage to brain parenchyma. In the case of ischemic stroke, blood fails to reach its target destination whereas in hemorrhagic stroke, extravasation of blood occurs outside of the blood vessel lumen, resulting in direct damage to brain parenchyma. As these acute events can be neurologically devastating, if not fatal, development of novel therapeutics are urgently needed. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an attractive model for the study of cerebrovascular disease because of its morphological and physiological similarity to human cerebral vasculature, its ability to be genetically manipulated, and its fecundity allowing for large-scale, phenotype-based screens.}

Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent {GPU}.

Using confocal microscopy we show that zebrafish ventricles are topologically similar to those of the mammalian brain.We describe a new method for measuring the dynamics of molecular transport within the ventricles of live zebrafish by means of the uncaging of a fluorescein derivative. Furthermore, we determine that in 5–6 days post-fertilization zebrafish, the dispersal of molecules in the ventricles is driven by a combination of ciliary motion and diffusion. The zebrafish presents a tractable system with the advantage of genetics, size and transparency for exploring ventricular physiology and for mounting large-scale high throughput experiments.}

Glioblastomas are infiltrated by a high number of microglia, which promote tumor growth and surrounding tissue invasion. However, it is unclear how microglia and glioma cells physically interact and if there are differences, depending on glioma cell type. Hence, we have developed a novel live imaging assay to study microglia-glioma interactions in vivo in the zebrafish brain. We transplanted well-established human glioblastoma cell lines, U87 and U251, into transgenic zebrafish lines with labelled macrophages/microglia. Our confocal live imaging results show distinct interactions between microglia and U87, as well as U251 glioblastoma cells that differ in number and nature. Importantly these interactions do not appear to be antitumoral as zebrafish microglia do not engulf and phagocytose the human glioblastoma cells. Finally, xenotransplants into the irf8-/- zebrafish mutant that lacks microglia, as well as pharmacological inhibition of the {CSF}-1 receptor ({CSF}-{1R}) on microglia, confirm a prominent role for zebrafish microglia in promoting human glioblastoma cell growth. This new model will be an important tool for drug screening and the development of future immunotherapeutics targeting microglia within glioma.}

Despite their macrophage-like morphology and perivascular location, zebrafish {FGPs} appear molecularly most similar to lymphatic endothelium, and our imaging studies suggest that these cells emerge by differentiation from endothelium of the optic choroidal vascular plexus.

Three-dimensional imaging of whole organs recently became an important challenge to better understand their architecture and allow cell enumeration. Several protocols have thus been developed to enhance sample transparency, a limiting step for imaging large biological samples. However, none of these methods has been applied to the zebrafish testis. We tested five clearing protocols to determine if some of them could be applied with only small modifications to the testis. We compared clearing efficiency at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. {CUBIC} and {PACT} were suitable for an efficient transparency, an optimal optical penetration, the {GFP} fluorescence preservation and avoiding meaningful tissue deformation. Finally, we succeeded in whole testis {3D} capture at a cellular resolution with both {CUBIC} and {PACT}, which will be valuable in a standard workflow to investigate the {3D} architecture of the testis and its cellular content.

We used three-dimensional ({3D}) reconstructions of cleared transgenic wdr12:{GFP} medaka brains to demonstrate that this cell type is widespread in juvenile and to identify new regions containing {NE} cells. We established the gene expression profile of optic tectum ({OT}) {NE} cells by cell sorting followed by {RNA}-seq.

abstract = {A thorough understanding of optical properties of biological tissues is critical to effective treatment planning for therapies such as photodynamic therapy ({PDT}). In the last two decades, new technologies, such as broadband diffuse spectroscopy, have been developed to obtain in vivo data in humans that was not possible before. We found that the in vivo optical properties generally vary in the ranges μ(a) = 0.03-1.6 cm⁻¹ and μ'(s) = 1.2-40 cm⁻¹, although the actual range is tissue-type dependent. We have also examined the overall trend of the absorption spectra (for μ(a) and μ'(s)) as a function of wavelength within a 95\% confidence interval for various tissues in vivo. The impact of optical properties on light fluence rate is also discussed for various light application geometries including superficial, interstitial, and within a cavity.}

abstract = {Angiogenesis is necessary for tumor growth, making inhibition of vessel formation an excellent target for cancer therapy. Current assays for angiogenesis, however, are too complex to be practical for drug screening. Here, we demonstrate that the zebrafish is a viable whole animal model for screening small molecules that affect blood vessel formation. Blood vessel patterning is highly characteristic in the developing zebrafish embryo and the subintestinal vessels ({SIVs}) can be stained and visualized microscopically as a primary screen for compounds that affect angiogenesis. Small molecules added directly to the fish culture media diffuse into the embryo and induce observable, dose-dependent effects. To evaluate the zebrafish as a model, we used two angiogenesis inhibitors, {SU5416} and {TNP470}, both of which have been tested in mammalian systems. Both compounds caused a reduction in vessel formation when introduced to zebrafish embryos prior to the onset of angiogenesis. Short duration (1 h) exposure of {SU5416} was sufficient to block new angiogenic and vasculogenic vessel formation. In contrast, {TNP470} required continuous exposure to block {SIV} formation and had no apparent effect on vasculogenic vessel formation. To ascertain whether blood vessels in the zebrafish embryo respond to angiogenic compounds, we introduced human {VEGF} into embryos. Injection of {VEGF} caused an observable increase in {SIV} formation.}

In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called '{FlyPi}'. Our design is based on a {3D}-printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, {FlyPi} can be assembled for well under {\EUR100} and features optional modules for light-emitting diode ({LED})-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs approximately {\EUR200} or substantially less if the user is prepared to 'shop around'. All functions of {FlyPi} can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate {FlyPi}'s capabilities, we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate {FlyPi}'s utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of {FlyPi} make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres, and research labs.}

Xenopus offers advantages of a non-mammalian system, including high fecundity, external development, and simple housing requirements, with additional advantages of large embryos, highly conserved developmental processes, and close evolutionary relationship to higher vertebrates. There are two main species of Xenopus used in biomedical research, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis; the common perception is that both species are excellent models for embryological and cell biological studies, but only Xenopus tropicalis is useful as a genetic model. The recent completion of the Xenopus laevis genome sequence combined with implementation of genome editing tools, such as {TALENs} (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) and {CRISPR}-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-{CRISPR} associated nucleases), greatly facilitates the use of both Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis for understanding gene function in development and disease. In this paper, we review recent advances made in Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis with {TALENs} and {CRISPR}-Cas and discuss the various approaches that have been used to generate knockout and knock-in animals in both species. These advances show that both Xenopus species are useful for genetic approaches and in particular counters the notion that Xenopus laevis is not amenable to genetic manipulations.

In mammals brain lymphatics were only recently discovered, with significant implications for physiology and disease. We examined zebrafish for the presence of brain lymphatics and found loosely connected endothelial cells with lymphatic molecular signature covering parts of the brain without forming endothelial tubular structures. These brain lymphatic endothelial cells ({BLECs}) derive from venous endothelium, are distinct from macrophages, and are sensitive to loss of Vegfc. {BLECs} endocytose macromolecules in a selective manner, which can be blocked by injection of mannose receptor ligands. This first report on brain lymphatic endothelial cells in a vertebrate embryo identifies cells with unique features, including the uptake of macromolecules at a single cell level. Future studies will address whether this represents an uptake mechanism that is conserved in mammals and how these cells affect functions of the embryonic and adult brain.}

To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective.

In contrast, the extracellular matrix in zebrafish allows substantial axon re-growth, leading to recovery of movement. However, little is known about regulation and composition of the growth-promoting extracellular matrix. Here we demonstrate that activity of the Wnt/\beta-catenin pathway in fibroblast-like cells in the lesion site is pivotal for axon re-growth and functional recovery. Wnt/\beta-catenin signaling induces expression of col12a1a/b and deposition of Collagen {XII}, which is necessary for axons to actively navigate the non-neural lesion site environment. Overexpression of col12a1a rescues the effects of Wnt/\beta-catenin pathway inhibition and is sufficient to accelerate regeneration. We demonstrate that in a vertebrate of high regenerative capacity, Wnt/\beta-catenin signaling controls the composition of the lesion site extracellular matrix and we identify Collagen {XII} as a promoter of axonal regeneration. These findings imply that the Wnt/\beta-catenin pathway and Collagen {XII} may be targets for extracellular matrix manipulations in non-regenerating species.Following spinal injury in zebrafish, non-neural cells establish an extracellular matrix to promote axon re-growth but how this is regulated is unclear. Here, the authors show that Wnt/\beta-catenin signaling in fibroblast-like cells at a lesion activates axon re-growth via deposition of Collagen {XII}.}

abstract = {The vestibular system, which detects gravity and motion, is crucial to survival, but the neural circuits processing vestibular information remain incompletely characterised. In part, this is because the movement needed to stimulate the vestibular system hampers traditional neuroscientific methods. Optical trapping uses focussed light to apply forces to targeted objects, typically ranging from nanometres to a few microns across. In principle, optical trapping of the otoliths (ear stones) could produce fictive vestibular stimuli in a stationary animal. Here we use optical trapping in vivo to manipulate 55-micron otoliths in larval zebrafish. Medial and lateral forces on the otoliths result in complementary corrective tail movements, and lateral forces on either otolith are sufficient to cause a rolling correction in both eyes. This confirms that optical trapping is sufficiently powerful and precise to move large objects in vivo, and sets the stage for the functional mapping of the resulting vestibular processing.The neural circuits of the vestibular system, which detects gravity and motion, remain incompletely characterised. Here the authors use an optical trap to manipulate otoliths (ear stones) in zebrafish larvae, and elicit corrective tail movements and eye rolling, thus establishing a method for mapping vestibular processing.}

We report the automated dechorionation of 1600 embryos at once at 4 h postfertilization (hpf) and placement of the dechorionated embryos into 96-well plates for exposure by 6 hpf. The process removed ≥95\% of the embryos from their chorions with 2\% embryo mortality by 24 hpf, and 2\% of the embryos malformed at 120 hpf. The robotic embryo placement allocated 6-hpf embryos to 94.7\% ± 4.2\% of the wells in multiple 96-well trials. The rate of embryo mortality was 2.8\% (43 of 1536) from robotic handling, the rate of missed wells was 1.2\% (18 of 1536), and the frequency of multipicks was \textless 0.1\%.

Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process {2D} images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of {3D} volumes. In this work we propose an approach to {3D} image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our {CNN} is trained end-to-end on {MRI} volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

We have isolated a duplicated zebrafish {VegfA} locus, termed {VegfAb}, and a duplicate {RTK} locus with homology to {KDR}/{FLK1} (named Kdrb). Morpholino-disrupted {VegfAb} embryos develop a normal circulatory system until approximately 2 to 3 days after fertilization (dpf), when defects in angiogenesis permit blood to extravasate into many tissues. Unlike the {VegfAa}(121) and {VegfAa}(165) isoforms, the {VegfAb} isoforms {VegfAb}(171) and {VegfAb}(210) are not normally secreted when expressed in mammalian tissue culture cells. The Kdrb locus encodes a 1361-amino acid transmembrane receptor with strong homology to mammalian {KDR}. Combined knockdown of both {RTKs} leads to defects in vascular development, suggesting that they cooperate in mediating the vascular effects of {VegfA} in zebrafish development. Both {VegfAa} and {VegfAb} can individually bind and promote phosphorylation of both Flk1 (Kdra) and Kdrb proteins in vitro.

In this review, we focus on the utility of zebrafish in characterizing ethanol-induced developmental defects. A growing number of laboratories have focused on using zebrafish to examine ethanol-induced defects in craniofacial, cardiac, ocular, and neural development, as well as cognitive and behavioral impairments. Growing evidence supports that genetic predisposition plays a role in these ethanol-induced defects, yet little is understood about these gene-ethanol interactions. With a high degree of genetic amenability, zebrafish is at the forefront of identifying and characterizing the gene-ethanol interactions that underlie {FASD}. Because of the conservation of gene function between zebrafish and humans, these studies will directly translate to studies of candidate genes in human populations and allow for better diagnosis and treatment of {FASD}.}

In particular, the availability of a straightforward transgenesis assay and the near completion of the Xenopus tropicalis genome are enabling significant advances to be made in our understanding of the major remaining problems of metamorphosis: the extraordinary tissue specificity of responses, the precise timing of morphological changes, the degree of cell autonomy of hormone responses and developmental competence.

This tailors an exponential intensity increase along the illuminating propagation-invariant field, enabling the redistribution of intensity strategically within a sample to maximize signal and minimize irradiation. A key attribute of this method is that only minimal knowledge of the specimen transmission properties is required. We numerically quantify the imaging capabilities of attenuation-compensated Airy and Bessel light sheets, showing that increased depth penetration is gained without compromising any other beam attributes. This powerful yet straightforward concept, combined with the self-healing properties of the propagation-invariant field, improves the contrast-to-noise ratio of light-sheet microscopy up to eightfold across the entire field of view in thick biological specimens. This improvement can significantly increase the imaging capabilities of light-sheet microscopy techniques using Airy, Bessel, and other propagation-invariant beam types, paving the way for widespread uptake by the biomedical community.}

abstract = {Movement disorders can be primarily divided into hypokinetic and hyperkinetic. Most of the hypokinetic syndromes are associated with the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease ({PD}). By contrast, hyperkinetic syndromes encompass a broader array of diseases, including dystonia, essential tremor, or Huntington's disease. The discovery of effective therapies for these disorders has been challenging and has also involved the development and characterization of accurate animal models for the screening of new drugs. Zebrafish constitutes an alternative vertebrate model for the study of movement disorders. The neuronal circuitries involved in movement in zebrafish are well characterized, and most of the associated molecular mechanisms are highly conserved. Particularly, zebrafish models of {PD} have contributed to a better understanding of the role of several genes implicated in the disease. Furthermore, zebrafish is a vertebrate model particularly suited for large-scale drug screenings. The relatively small size of zebrafish, optical transparency, and lifecycle, are key characteristics that facilitate the study of multiple compounds at the same time. Several transgenic, knockdown, and mutant zebrafish lines have been generated and characterized. Therefore, it is central to critically analyze these zebrafish lines and understand their suitability as models of movement disorders. Here, we revise the pathogenic mechanisms, phenotypes, and responsiveness to pharmacotherapies of zebrafish lines of the most common movement disorders. A systematic review of the literature was conducted by including all studies reporting the characterization of zebrafish models of the movement disorders selected from five bibliographic databases. A total of 63 studies were analyzed, and the most relevant data within the scope of this review were gathered. The majority (62\%) of the studies were focused in the characterization of zebrafish models of {PD}. Overall, the zebrafish models included display conserved biochemical and neurobehavioral features of the phenomenology in humans. Nevertheless, in light of what is known for all animal models available, the use of zebrafish as a model for drug discovery requires further optimization. Future technological developments alongside with a deeper understanding of the molecular bases of these disorders should enable the development of novel zebrafish lines that can prove useful for drug discovery for movement disorders.}

abstract = {Myelinating oligodendrocytes are essential for central nervous system ({CNS}) formation and function. Their disruption is implicated in numerous neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, recent studies have indicated that oligodendrocytes may be tractable for treatment of disease. In recent years, zebrafish have become well established for the study of myelinating oligodendrocyte biology and drug discovery in vivo. Here, by automating the delivery of zebrafish larvae to a spinning disk confocal microscope, we were able to automate high-resolution imaging of myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo. From there, we developed an image analysis pipeline that facilitated a screen of compounds with epigenetic and post-translational targets for their effects on regulating myelinating oligodendrocyte number. This screen identified novel compounds that strongly promote myelinating oligodendrocyte formation in vivo. Our imaging platform and analysis pipeline is flexible and can be employed for high-resolution imaging-based screens of broad interest using zebrafish. \copyright 2018, Early et al.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent advances in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ({CRISPR})/{CRISPR}-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome editing have led to the use of long single-stranded {DNA} ({lssDNA}) molecules for generating conditional mutations. However, there is still limited available data on the efficiency and reliability of this method. {RESULTS}: We generated conditional mouse alleles using {lssDNA} donor templates and performed extensive characterization of the resulting mutations. We observed that the use of {lssDNA} molecules as donors efficiently yielded founders bearing the conditional allele, with seven out of nine projects giving rise to modified alleles. However, rearranged alleles including nucleotide changes, indels, local rearrangements and additional integrations were also frequently generated by this method. Specifically, we found that alleles containing unexpected point mutations were found in three of the nine projects analyzed. Alleles originating from illegitimate repairs or partial integration of the donor were detected in eight projects. Furthermore, additional integrations of donor molecules were identified in four out of the seven projects analyzed by copy counting. This highlighted the requirement for a thorough allele validation by polymerase chain reaction, sequencing and copy counting of the mice generated through this method. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using {lssDNA} donors to generate thus far problematic point mutations distant from active {CRISPR} cutting sites by targeting two distinct genes (Gckr and Rims1). We propose a strategy to perform extensive quality control and validation of both types of mouse models generated using {lssDNA} donors. {CONCLUSION}: {lssDNA} donors reproducibly generate conditional alleles and can be used to introduce point mutations away from {CRISPR}/Cas9 cutting sites in mice. However, our work demonstrates that thorough quality control of new models is essential prior to reliably experimenting with mice generated by this method. These advances in genome editing techniques shift the challenge of mutagenesis from generation to the validation of new mutant models.}

abstract = {Fertilization is fundamental for sexual reproduction, yet its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that an oocyte-expressed Ly6/{uPAR} protein, which we call Bouncer, is a crucial fertilization factor in zebrafish. Membrane-bound Bouncer mediates sperm-egg binding and is thus essential for sperm entry into the egg. Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species fertilization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific fertilization in fish. Bouncer's closest homolog in tetrapods, {SPACA4}, is restricted to the male germline in internally fertilizing vertebrates, which suggests that our findings in fish have relevance to human biology.

abstract = {Female gamete production relies on coordinated molecular and cellular processes that occur in the ovary throughout oogenesis. In fish, as in other vertebrates, these processes have been extensively studied both in terms of endocrine/paracrine regulation and protein expression and activity. The role of small non-coding {RNAs} in the regulation of animal reproduction remains however largely unknown and poorly investigated, despite a growing interest for the importance of {miRNAs} in a wide variety of biological processes. Here, we analyzed the role of {miR}-202, a {miRNA} predominantly expressed in male and female gonads in several vertebrate species. We studied its expression in the medaka ovary and generated a mutant line (using {CRISPR}/Cas9 genome editing) to determine its importance for reproductive success with special interest for egg production. Our results show that {miR}-202-5p is the most abundant mature form of the {miRNA} and that it is expressed in granulosa cells and in the unfertilized egg. The knock out ({KO}) of mir-202 gene resulted in a strong phenotype both in terms of number and quality of eggs produced. Mutant females exhibited either no egg production or produced a dramatically reduced number of eggs that could not be fertilized, ultimately leading to no reproductive success. We quantified the size distribution of the oocytes in the ovary of {KO} females and performed a large-scale transcriptomic analysis approach to identified dysregulated molecular pathways. Together, cellular and molecular analyses indicate that the lack of {miR}-202 impairs the early steps of oogenesis/folliculogenesis and decreases the number of large (i.e. vitellogenic) follicles, ultimately leading to dramatically reduced female fecundity. This study sheds new light on the regulatory mechanisms that control the early steps of follicular development, including possible targets of {miR}-202-5p, and provides the first in vivo functional evidence that a gonad-predominant {microRNA} may have a major role in female reproduction.}

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Pre-clinical drug discovery for multiple sclerosis ({MS}) is a labor intensive activity to perform in rodent models. This is owing to the long duration of disease induction and observation of treatment effects in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ({EAE}) model. We propose a novel adult zebrafish based model which offers a quick and simple protocol that can used to screen candidates as a step between in vitro experiments and rodent studies. The experiments conducted for this manuscript were to standardize a suitable model of {EAE} in adult zebrafish and validate it using known modulators. {METHODS}: The {EAE} model was developed by disease induction with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - 35-55 ({MOG}) and observation of survival, clinical signs and body weight changes. We have validated this model using fingolimod. We have further performed detailed validation using dimethyl fumarate, dexamethasone and {SR1001}, which are known modulators of rodent {EAE}. {RESULTS}: The immunization dose for the disease induction was observed to be 0.6mg/ml of {MOG} in {CFA} (Complete Freund's adjuvant), injected subcutaneously (s.c.) near spinal vertebrae. In the validation study with fingolimod, we have demonstrated the modulation of disease symptoms, which were also confirmed by histopathological evaluation. Furthermore, detailed validation with three other known drugs showed that our observations concur with those reported in conventional rodent models. {DISCU\SSION}: We have standardized and validated the adult zebrafish {EAE} model. This model can help get a quick idea of in vivo activity of drugs in a week using very low quantities of candidate compounds. Further work will be required to define this model particularly as it is found that zebrafish may not express a {MOG} homologue. Copyright \copyright 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is emerging as an increasingly successful model for translational research on human neurological disorders. In this review, we appraise the high degree of neurological and behavioural resemblance of zebrafish with humans. It is highly validated as a powerful vertebrate model for investigating human neurodegenerative diseases. The neuroanatomic and neurochemical pathways of zebrafish brain exhibit a profound resemblance with the human brain. Physiological, emotional and social behavioural pattern similarities between them have also been well established. Interestingly, zebrafish models have been used successfully to simulate the pathology of Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) as well as Tauopathy. Their relatively simple nervous system and the optical transparency of the embryos permit real-time neurological imaging. Here, we further elaborate on the use of recent real-time imaging techniques to obtain vital insights into the neurodegeneration that occurs in {AD}. Zebrafish is adeptly suitable for Ca2+ imaging, which provides a better understanding of neuronal activity and axonal dystrophy in a non-invasive manner. Three-dimensional imaging in zebrafish is a rapidly evolving technique, which allows the visualisation of the whole organism for an elaborate in vivo functional and neurophysiological analysis in disease condition. Suitability to high-throughput screening and similarity with humans makes zebrafish an excellent model for screening neurospecific compounds. Thus, the zebrafish model can be pivotal in bridging the gap from the bench to the bedside. This fish is becoming an increasingly successful model to understand {AD} with further scope for investigation in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, which promises exciting research opportunities in the future.}

abstract = {Intracerebral haemorrhage ({ICH}) is a devastating condition with limited treatment options, and current understanding of pathophysiology is incomplete. Spontaneous cerebral bleeding is a characteristic of the human condition that has proven difficult to recapitulate in existing pre-clinical rodent models. Zebrafish larvae are frequently used as vertebrate disease models and are associated with several advantages, including high fecundity, optical translucency and non-protected status prior to 5 days post-fertilisation. Furthermore, other groups have shown that zebrafish larvae can exhibit spontaneous {ICH}. The aim of this study was to investigate whether such models can be utilised to study the pathological consequences of bleeding in the brain, in the context of pre-clinical {ICH} research. Here, we compared existing genetic (bubblehead) and chemically inducible (atorvastatin) zebrafish larval models of spontaneous {ICH} and studied the subsequent disease processes. Through live, non-invasive imaging of transgenic fluorescent reporter lines and behavioural assessment we quantified brain injury, locomotor function and neuroinflammation following {ICH}. We show that {ICH} in both zebrafish larval models is comparable in timing, frequency and location. {ICH} results in increased brain cell death and a persistent locomotor deficit. Additionally, in haemorrhaged larvae we observed a significant increase in macrophage recruitment to the site of injury. Live in vivo imaging allowed us to track active macrophage-based phagocytosis of dying brain cells 24 hours after haemorrhage. Morphological analyses and quantification indicated that an increase in overall macrophage activation occurs in the haemorrhaged brain. Our study shows that in zebrafish larvae, bleeding in the brain induces quantifiable phenotypic outcomes that mimic key features of human {ICH}. We hope that this methodology will enable the pre-clinical {ICH} community to adopt the zebrafish larval model as an alternative to rodents, supporting future high throughput drug screening and as a complementary approach to elucidating crucial mechanisms associated with {ICH} pathophysiology.}

We find that tmem33 localises to the endoplasmic reticulum in zebrafish {ECs} and is required for cytosolic calcium oscillations in response to Vegfa. tmem33-mediated endothelial calcium oscillations are critical for formation of endothelial tip cell filopodia and {EC} migration. Global or endothelial-cell-specific knockdown of tmem33 impairs multiple downstream effects of {VEGF} including {ERK} phosphorylation, Notch signalling and embryonic vascular development.

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a popular model organism for many reasons, including the fact that it is amenable to various forms of genetic manipulation. The {RNA}-guided {CRISPR}/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis approaches have provided powerful tools to manipulate the genome toward developing new disease models and understanding the pathophysiology of human diseases. {CRISPR}-based approaches are being used for the generation of both knockout and knock-in alleles, and also for applications including transcriptional modulation, epigenome editing, live imaging of the genome, and lineage tracing. Currently, substantial effort is being made to improve the specificity of Cas9, and to expand the target coverage of the Cas9 enzymes. Novel types of naturally occurring {CRISPR} systems [Cas12a (Cpf1); engineered variants of Cas9, such as {xCas9} and {SpCas9}-{NG}], are being studied and applied to genome editing. Since the majority of pathogenic mutations are single point mutations, development of base editors to convert C:G to T:A or A:T to G:C has further strengthened the {CRISPR} toolbox.

abstract = {Background: Medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a popular animal model used in vertebrate genetic analysis. Recently, an efficient (\~ 30\%) knock-in system via non-homologous end joining ({NHEJ}) was established in zebrafish using the {CRISPR}/Cas9 system. If the same technique were applicable in medaka, it would greatly expand the usefulness of this model organism. The question of the applicability of {CRISPR}/Cas9 in medaka, however, has yet to be addressed. Results: We report the highly efficient generation of knock-in transgenic medaka via non-homologous end joining ({NHEJ}). Donor plasmid containing a heat-shock promoter and a reporter gene was co-injected with a short guide {RNA} ({sgRNA}) targeted for genome digestion, an {sgRNA} targeted for donor plasmid digestion, and Cas9 {mRNA}. Broad transgene expression in the expression domain of a target gene was observed in approximately 25\% of injected embryos. By raising these animals, we established stable knock-in transgenic fish with several different constructs for five genetic loci, obtaining transgenic founders at efficiencies of \textgreater 50\% for all five loci. Further, we show that the method is useful for obtaining mutant alleles. In the experiments where transgene integrations were targeted between the transcription start site and the initiation methionine, the resultant transgenic fish became mutant alleles. Conclusion: With its simplicity, design flexibility, and high efficiency, we propose that {CRISPR}/Cas9-mediated knock-in via {NHEJ} will become a standard method for the generation of transgenic and mutant medaka.}

abstract = {The meninges are membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system. In the head, the meninges lie between the brain and the skull, and interact closely with both during development. The cranial meninges originate from a mesenchymal sheath on the surface of the developing brain, called primary meninx, and undergo differentiation into three layers with distinct histological characteristics: the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. While genetic regulation of meningeal development is still poorly understood, mouse mutants and other models with meningeal defects have demonstrated the importance of the meninges to normal development of the calvaria and the brain. For the calvaria, the interactions with the meninges are necessary for the progression of calvarial osteogenesis during early development. In later stages, the meninges control the patterning of the skull and the fate of the sutures. For the brain, the meninges regulate diverse processes including cell survival, cell migration, generation of neurons from progenitors, and vascularization. Also, the meninges serve as a stem cell niche for the brain in the postnatal life. Given these important roles of the meninges, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying meningeal development can provide novel insights into the coordinated development of the head. \copyright 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

abstract = {The brain ventricular system ({BVS}) consists of brain ventricles and channels connecting ventricles filled with cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}). The disturbance of {CSF} flow has been linked to neurodegenerative disease including hydrocephalus, which manifests itself as an abnormal expansion of {BVS}. This relatively common developmental disorder has been observed in human and domesticated animals and linked to functional deficiency of various cells lineages facing {BVS}, including the choroid plexus or ependymal cells that generate {CSF} or the ciliated cells that cilia beating generates {CSF} flow. To understand the underlying causes of hydrocephalus, several animal models were developed, including rodents (mice, rat, and hamster) and zebrafish. At another side of a spectrum of {BVS} anomalies there is the "slit-ventricle" syndrome, which develops due to insufficient inflation of {BVS}. Recent advances in functional genetics of zebrafish brought to light novel genetic elements involved in development of {BVS} and circulation of {CSF}. This review aims to reveal common elements of morphologically different {BVS} of zebrafish as a typical representative of teleosts and other vertebrates and illustrate useful features of the zebrafish model for studies of {BVS}. Along this line, recent analyses of the two novel zebrafish mutants affecting different subunits of the potassium voltage-gated channels allowed to emphasize an important functional convergence of the evolutionarily conserved elements of protein transport essential for {BVS} development, which were revealed by the zebrafish and mouse studies.}

Datasets that can be used to train and test computer algorithms, however, are often small due to the difficulties in obtaining experts to segment enough examples. Citizen science provides a potential solution to this problem but the feasibility of using the public to identify and segment anatomy in a medical image has not been investigated. Our study therefore aimed to explore the feasibility, in terms of performance and motivation, of using citizens for such purposes. Public involvement was woven into the study design and evaluation. Twenty-nine citizens were recruited and, after brief training, asked to segment the spine from a dataset of 150 magnetic resonance images. Participants segmented as many images as they could within three one-hour sessions. Their accuracy was evaluated by comparing them, as individuals and as a combined consensus, to the segmentations of three experts. Questionnaires and a focus group were used to determine the citizens' motivation for taking part and their experience of the study. Citizen segmentation accuracy, in terms of agreement with the expert consensus segmentation, varied considerably between individual citizens. The citizen consensus, however, was close to the expert consensus, indicating that when pooled, citizens may be able to replace or supplement experts for generating large image datasets. Personal interest and a desire to help were the two most common reasons for taking part in the study.}

The zebrafish animal model is emerging as a valuable model for the investigation of {AD} and neurodegenerative drug discovery. The main genes involved in human {AD} have homologous counterparts in zebrafish and have conserved function. The basic brain structure of the zebrafish is also conserved when compared to the mammalian brain. Recently an {AD} model was established by administering okadaic acid to zebrafish. It was used to test the efficacy of a novel drug, lanthionine ketimine-5-ethyl ester, and to elucidate its mechanism of action.

We formulate the problem as an energy minimisation problem over a densely-connected conditional random field and iteratively update the training targets to obtain pixelwise object segmentations.

abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Automatic segmentation of organs-at-risk ({OARs}) is a key step in radiation treatment planning to reduce human efforts and bias. Deep convolutional neural networks ({DCNN}) have shown great success in many medical image segmentation applications but there are still challenges in dealing with large {3D} images for optimal results. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel {DCNN} method for thoracic {OARs} segmentation using cropped {3D} images. {METHODS}: To segment the five organs (left and right lungs, heart, esophagus and spinal cord) from the thoracic {CT} scans, preprocessing to unify the voxel spacing and intensity was first performed, a {3D} U-Net was then trained on resampled thoracic images to localize each organ, then the original images were cropped to only contain one organ and served as the input to each individual organ segmentation network. The segmentation maps were then merged to get the final results. The network structures were optimized for each step, as well as the training and testing strategies. A novel testing augmentation with multiple iterations of image cropping was used. The networks were trained on 36 thoracic {CT} scans with expert annotations provided by the organizers of the 2017 {AAPM} Thoracic Auto-segmentation Challenge and tested on the challenge testing dataset as well as a private dataset. {RESULTS}: The proposed method earned second place in the live phase of the challenge and first place in the subsequent ongoing phase using a newly developed testing augmentation approach. It showed superior-than-human performance on average in terms of Dice scores (spinal cord: 0.893 ± 0.044, right lung: 0.972 ± 0.021, left lung: 0.979 ± 0.008, heart: 0.925 ± 0.015, esophagus: 0.726 ± 0.094), mean surface distance (spinal cord: 0.662 ± 0.248 mm, right lung: 0.933 ± 0.574 mm, left lung: 0.586 ± 0.285 mm, heart: 2.297 ± 0.492 mm, esophagus: 2.341 ± 2.380 mm) and 95\% Hausdorff distance (spinal cord: 1.893 ± 0.627 mm, right lung: 3.958 ± 2.845 mm, left lung: 2.103 ± 0.938 mm, heart: 6.570 ± 1.501 mm, esophagus: 8.714 ± 10.588 mm). It also achieved good performance in the private dataset and reduced the editing time to 7.5 min per patient following automatic segmentation. {CONCLUSIONS}: The proposed {DCNN} method demonstrated good performance in automatic {OAR} segmentation from thoracic {CT} scans. It has the potential for eventual clinical adoption of deep learning in radiation treatment planning due to improved accuracy and reduced cost for {OAR} segmentation. \copyright 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}

abstract = {Accurate and automatic organ segmentation is critical for computer-aided analysis towards clinical decision support and treatment planning. State-of-the-art approaches have achieved remarkable segmentation accuracy on large organs, such as the liver and kidneys. However, most of these methods do not perform well on small organs, such as the pancreas, gallbladder, and adrenal glands, especially when lacking sufficient training data. This paper presents an automatic approach for small organ segmentation with limited training data using two cascaded steps-localization and segmentation. The localization stage involves the extraction of the region of interest after the registration of images to a common template and during the segmentation stage, a voxel-wise label map of the extracted region of interest is obtained and then transformed back to the original space. In the localization step, we propose to utilize a graph-based groupwise image registration method to build the template for registration so as to minimize the potential bias and avoid getting a fuzzy template. More importantly, a novel knowledge-aided convolutional neural network is proposed to improve segmentation accuracy in the second stage. This proposed network is flexible and can combine the effort of both deep learning and traditional methods, consequently achieving better segmentation relative to either of individual methods. The {ISBI} 2015 {VISCERAL} challenge dataset is used to evaluate the presented approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms cutting-edge deep learning approaches, traditional forest-based approaches, and multi-atlas approaches in the segmentation of small organs.}

We applied our method to the segmentation of tibial cartilage in low field knee {MRI} scans and tested it on 114 unseen scans.

In the latter approach, the features and the classifier have been carefully adapted to the problem at hand. That we were able to get better results by a deep learning architecture that autonomously learns the features from the images is the main insight of this study.}

In cultured cell-based experiments, we recently identified the hypoxia-inducible protein G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0s2) as a positive regulator of {OXPHOS}, and showed that G0s2 protects cultured cardiomyocytes from hypoxia. In this study, we examined the in vivo protective role of G0s2 against hypoxia by generating both loss-of-function and gain-of-function models of g0s2 in zebrafish. Zebrafish harboring transcription activator-like effector nuclease ({TALEN})-mediated knockout of g0s2 lost hypoxic tolerance. Conversely, cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic zebrafish hearts exhibited strong tolerance against hypoxia. To clarify the mechanism by which G0s2 protects cardiac function under hypoxia, we introduced a mitochondrially targeted {FRET}-based {ATP} biosensor into zebrafish heart to visualize {ATP} dynamics in in vivo beating hearts. In addition, we employed a mosaic overexpression model of g0s2 to compare the contraction and {ATP} dynamics between g0s2-expressing and non-expressing cardiomyocytes, side-by-side within the same heart. These techniques revealed that g0s2-expressing cardiomyocyte populations exhibited preserved contractility coupled with maintained intra-mitochondrial {ATP} concentrations even under hypoxic condition. Collectively, these results demonstrate that G0s2 provides ischemic tolerance in vivo by maintaining {ATP} production, and therefore represents a promising therapeutic target for hypoxia-related diseases. \copyright 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.}

Recently, various works address the problem of segmenting mitochondria in electron microscopy images. Manual segmentation of mitochondria is difficult and may not have high accuracy as automatic segmentation can yield. In this paper, we present a deep convolutional neural network approach for automatic segmentation of mitochondria in brain tissue, specifically the {CA1} hippocampus region imaged by an focusedion beam scanning electron microscope. The performance of the proposed method has been quantitatively evaluated. According to our experiments, deep convolutional neural network is a suitable solution for mitochondria segmentation. Results have been compared with previous studies that segment the mitochondria on {CA1} Hippocampus Dataset. The proposed deep learning system produces promising results for segmentation of electron microscopy images.},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Ocular lens clouding is termed as cataract, which depending on the onset, is classified as congenital or age-related. Developing new cataract treatments requires new models. Thus far, Xenopus embryos have not been evaluated as a system for studying cataract. {RESULTS}: We characterized the developmental process of lens formation in Xenopus laevis tailbuds and tadpoles, and we disrupted the orthologues of three mammalian cataract-linked genes in F0 by {CRISPR}/Cas9. We assessed the consequences of gene inactivation by combining external examination with histochemical analyses and functional vision assays. Inactivating the key metazoan eye development transcription factor gene pax6 produces a strong eye phenotype including an absence of eye tissue. Inactivating the genes for gap-junction protein and a nuclease, gja8 and dnase2b, produces lens defects that share several features of human cataracts, including impaired vision acuity, nuclei retention in lens fiber cells, and actin fibers disorganization. We tested the potential improvement of the visual acuity of gja8 crispant tadpoles upon treatment with the molecular chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate. {CONCLUSION}: Xenopus is a valuable model organism to understand the molecular pathology of congenital eye defects, including cataracts, and to screen molecules with a potential to prevent or reverse cataracts. \copyright 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

Due to the utilization of modern biochemical and biomedical techniques, the number of identified disease-associated genes is increasing rapidly. Modeling of congenital human disease in animals is key to our understanding of the biological mechanism underlying pathological processes and thus developing novel potential treatment options. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been established as a versatile small vertebrate organism that is widely used for studying human inherited diseases. Genetic accessibility in combination with elegant experimental methods in zebrafish permit modeling of human genetic diseases and dissecting the perturbation of underlying cellular networks and physiological processes. Beyond its utility for genetic analysis and pathophysiological and mechanistic studies, zebrafish embryos, and larvae are amenable for phenotypic screening approaches employing high-content and high-throughput experiments using automated microscopy. This includes large-scale chemical screening experiments using genetic models for searching for disease-modulating compounds. Phenotype-based approaches of drug discovery have been successfully performed in diverse zebrafish-based screening applications with various phenotypic readouts. As a result, these can lead to the identification of candidate substances that are further examined in preclinical and clinical trials. In this review, we discuss zebrafish models for inherited kidney disease as well as requirements and considerations for the technical realization of drug screening experiments in zebrafish.}

In humans, abnormal maternal thyroid hormone levels during early pregnancy are associated with decreased offspring {IQ} and modified brain structure. As numerous environmental chemicals disrupt thyroid hormone signalling, we questioned whether exposure to ubiquitous chemicals affects thyroid hormone responses during early neurogenesis. We established a mixture of 15 common chemicals at concentrations reported in human amniotic fluid. An in vivo larval reporter ({GFP}) assay served to determine integrated thyroid hormone transcriptional responses. Dose-dependent effects of short-term (72 h) exposure to single chemicals and the mixture were found. {qPCR} on dissected brains showed significant changes in thyroid hormone-related genes including receptors, deiodinases and neural differentiation markers. Further, exposure to mixture also modified neural proliferation as well as neuron and oligodendrocyte size. Finally, exposed tadpoles showed behavioural responses with dose-dependent reductions in mobility. In conclusion, exposure to a mixture of ubiquitous chemicals at concentrations found in human amniotic fluid affect thyroid hormone-dependent transcription, gene expression, brain development and behaviour in early embryogenesis. As thyroid hormone signalling is strongly conserved across vertebrates the results suggest that ubiquitous chemical mixtures could be exerting adverse effects on foetal human brain development.}

However, determining how underlying developmental processes are affected by these mutations remains a significant challenge in the field. Zebrafish is an established model system in developmental neurogenetics that may be useful in uncovering the mechanisms of these mutations. Here we describe the use of voxel-intensity, deformation field, and volume-based morphometric techniques for the systematic and unbiased analysis of gene knock-down and environmental exposure-induced phenotypes in zebrafish. We first present a computational method for brain segmentation based on transgene expression patterns to create a comprehensive neuroanatomical map. This map allowed us to disclose statistically significant changes in brain microstructure and composition in neurodevelopmental models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of morphometric techniques in measuring changes in the relative size of neuroanatomical subdivisions in atoh7 morphant larvae and in identifying phenotypes in larvae treated with valproic acid, a chemical demonstrated to increase the risk of autism in humans. These tools enable rigorous evaluation of the effects of gene mutations and environmental exposures on neural development, providing an entry point for cellular and molecular analysis of basic developmental processes as well as neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

However, the lack of consistent positioning of zebrafish embryos within wells of microtiter plates remains an obstacle for the comparative analysis of images acquired in automated screening assays. While technical solutions to the orientation problem exist, dissemination is often hindered by the lack of simple and inexpensive ways of distributing and duplicating tools. {RESULTS}: Here, we provide a cost effective method for the production of 96-well plate compatible zebrafish orientation tools using a desktop {3D} printer. The printed tools enable the positioning and orientation of zebrafish embryos within cavities formed in agarose. Their applicability is demonstrated by acquiring lateral and dorsal views of zebrafish embryos arrayed within microtiter plates using an automated screening microscope. This enables the consistent visualization of morphological phenotypes and reporter gene expression patterns. {CONCLUSIONS}: The designs are refined versions of previously demonstrated devices with added functionality and strongly reduced production costs. All corresponding {3D} models are freely available and digital design can be easily shared electronically. In combination with the increasingly widespread usage of {3D} printers, this provides access to the developed tools to a wide range of zebrafish users. Finally, the design files can serve as templates for other additive and subtractive fabrication methods.}

However, slow speed and the overenhancement of noise it produces in relatively homogeneous regions are two problems. We report algorithms designed to overcome these and other concerns. These algorithms include interpolated ahe, to speed up the method on general purpose computers; a version of interpolated ahe designed to run in a few seconds on feedback processors; a version of full ahe designed to run in under one second on custom {VLSI} hardware; weighted ahe, designed to improve the quality of the result by emphasizing pixels' contribution to the histogram in relation to their nearness to the result pixel; and clipped ahe, designed to overcome the problem of overenhancement of noise contrast.

Within the vertebrate brain, {NSPCs} are located within distinct neurogenic niches differing in their location, cellular composition, and proliferative behaviour. Heterogeneity in the {NSPC} population is hypothesized to reflect varying capacities for neurogenesis, plasticity and repair between different neurogenic zones. Since the discovery of adult neurogenesis, studies have predominantly focused on the behaviour and biological significance of adult {NSPCs} ({aNSPCs}) in rodents. However, compared to rodents, who show lifelong neurogenesis in only two restricted neurogenic niches, zebrafish exhibit constitutive neurogenesis across multiple stem cell niches that provide new neurons to every major brain division. Accordingly, zebrafish are a powerful model to probe the unique cellular and molecular profiles of {NSPCs} and investigate how these profiles govern tissue homeostasis and regenerative plasticity within distinct stem cell populations over time. Amongst the {NSPC} populations residing in the zebrafish central nervous system ({CNS}), proliferating radial-glia, quiescent radial-glia and neuro-epithelial-like cells comprise the majority. Here, we provide insight into the extent to which these distinct {NSPC} populations function and mature during development, respond to experience, and contribute to successful {CNS} regeneration in teleost fish. Together, our review brings to light the dynamic biological roles of these individual {NSPC} populations and showcases their diverse regenerative modes to achieve vertebrate brain repair later in life.

abstract = {The analysis of thin curvilinear objects in {3D} images is a complex and challenging task. In this article, we introduce a new, non-linear operator, called {RORPO} (Ranking the Orientation Responses of Path Operators). Inspired by the multidirectional paradigm currently used in linear filtering for thin structure analysis, {RORPO} is built upon the notion of path operator from mathematical morphology. This operator, unlike most operators commonly used for {3D} curvilinear structure analysis, is discrete, non-linear and non-local. From this new operator, two main curvilinear structure characteristics can be estimated: an intensity feature, that can be assimilated to a quantitative measure of curvilinearity; and a directional feature, providing a quantitative measure of the structure's orientation. We provide a full description of the structural and algorithmic details for computing these two features from {RORPO}, and we discuss computational issues. We experimentally assess {RORPO} by comparison with three of the most popular curvilinear structure analysis filters, namely Frangi Vesselness, Optimally Oriented Flux, and Hybrid Diffusion with Continuous Switch. In particular, we show that our method provides up to 8 percent more true positive and 50 percent less false positives than the next best method, on synthetic and real {3D} images.}

We recently demonstrated tissue clearing on one-week old tadpole brain (Fini et al., Sci Rep 7:43786, 2017). We here describe a further simplified version with clearing of small tissue samples (thickness inferior to 500 μm)) carried out by immersion in a fructose-based high-refractive index solution ({fbHRI}). By refining steps of the protocol, we were able to reduce the overall procedure time by two thirds. This offers the advantages of reducing the time of experimentation to a week and minimizes procedure-induced tissue deformations. This protocol can be easily adapted to be performed on thick section.

This gene has two major characteristics: (i) it is only expressed in radial glial progenitors in the brain of fish and (ii) it is exquisitely sensitive to estrogens. Based on these properties, we demonstrate that natural or synthetic hormones (alone or in binary mixture), including androgens or progestagens, and industrial chemicals induce a concentration-dependent {GFP} expression in radial glial progenitors. As {GFP} expression can be quantified by in vivo imaging, this model presents a very powerful tool to screen and characterize compounds potentially acting as estrogen mimics either directly or after metabolization by the zebrafish embryo. This study also shows that radial glial cells that act as stem cells are direct targets for a large panel of endocrine disruptors, calling for more attention regarding the impact of environmental estrogens and/or certain pharmaceuticals on brain development. Altogether these data identify this in vivo bioassay as an interesting alternative to detect estrogen mimics in hazard and risk assessment perspective.}

We constructed a transgenic plasmid ({pGFP}-{RFP}) carrying the {GFP} and red fluorescent protein ({RFP}) genes, and used a modified {TALEN} method to assemble a pair of {TALENs} for the core chromophore Y66 region of {GFP}. Embryo toxicity of {TALEN} messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) was far lower than the linearized plasmid; meanwhile, 76.3 \% embryos, green fluorescence of embryos decreased significantly after co-injection of {TALEN} {mRNA} and the linearized plasmid, but red fluorescence showed no significant change. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sequencing results showed that nearly 100 \% mutated {GFP} position was disrupted at the Y66 region of {GFP} in the co-injected medaka embryos, caused by {TALENs}. This led to random insertion-deletion of nucleotides, which affected the translation of {GFP} and disrupted {GFP} synthesis. This provides new experimental evidence for designing {TALEN} sites in genes for which only key functional domains are known. Our results show that a modified {TALEN} method can efficiently and specifically mediate a transgene knockout in medaka.

In this context, transparent model organisms such as the zebrafish Danio rerio in which developing tissues and organs can be easily observed and imaged using fluorescent proteins have become very popular. One limiting factor however is the acquisition of a sufficient amount of data, in standardized and reproducible conditions, to allow robust quantitative analysis. One way to improve this is by developing mounting methods to increase the number of embryos that can be imaged simultaneously in near-to-identical orientation. {RESULTS}: Here we present an improved mounting method allowing semi-automated and high-content imaging of zebrafish embryos. It is based on a {3D}-printed stamp which is used to create a {2D} coordinate system of multiple μ-wells in an agarose cast. Each μ-well models a negative of the average zebrafish embryo morphology between 22 and 96 h-post-fertilization. Due to this standardized and reproducible arrangement, it is possible to define a custom well plate in the respective imaging software that allows for a semi-automated imaging process. Furthermore, the improvement in Z-orientation significantly reduces post-processing and improves comparability of volumetric data while reducing light exposure and thus photo-bleaching and photo-toxicity, and improving signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}). {CONCLUSIONS}: We present here a new method that allows to standardize and improve mounting and imaging of embryos. The {3D}-printed stamp creates a {2D} coordinate system of μ-wells in an agarose cast thus standardizing specimen mounting and allowing high-content imaging of up to 44 live or mounted zebrafish embryos simultaneously in a semi-automated, well-plate like manner on inverted confocal microscopes. In summary, image data quality and acquisition efficiency (amount of data per time) are significantly improved. The latter might also be crucial when using the services of a microscopy facility.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The localization of objects of interest is a key initial step in most image analysis workflows. For biomedical image data, classical image-segmentation methods like thresholding or edge detection are typically used. While those methods perform well for labelled objects, they are reaching a limit when samples are poorly contrasted with the background, or when only parts of larger structures should be detected. Furthermore, the development of such pipelines requires substantial engineering of analysis workflows and often results in case-specific solutions. Therefore, we propose a new straightforward and generic approach for object-localization by template matching that utilizes multiple template images to improve the detection capacity. {RESULTS}: We provide a new implementation of template matching that offers higher detection capacity than single template approach, by enabling the detection of multiple template images. To provide an easy-to-use method for the automatic localization of objects of interest in microscopy images, we implemented multi-template matching as a Fiji plugin, a {KNIME} workflow and a python package. We demonstrate its application for the localization of entire, partial and multiple biological objects in zebrafish and medaka high-content screening datasets. The Fiji plugin can be installed by activating the Multi-Template-Matching and {IJ}-{OpenCV} update sites. The {KNIME} workflow is available on nodepit and {KNIME} Hub. Source codes and documentations are available on {GitHub} (https://github.com/multi-template-matching). {CONCLUSION}: The novel multi-template matching is a simple yet powerful object-localization algorithm, that requires no data-pre-processing or annotation. Our implementation can be used out-of-the-box by non-expert users for any type of {2D}-image. It is compatible with a large variety of applications including, for instance, analysis of large-scale datasets originating from automated microscopy, detection and tracking of objects in time-lapse assays, or as a general image-analysis step in any custom processing pipelines. Using different templates corresponding to distinct object categories, the tool can also be used for classification of the detected regions.}

The tg(tg:{mCherry}) reporter gene indicates a compensatory upregulation of thyroglobulin, the thyroid hormone precursor, in response to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis. Fish embryos were exposed to a negative control compound (3,4-dichloroaniline), or a concentration series of known goitrogenic compounds (resorcinol, methimazole, potassium perchlorate, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil, ethylenethiourea, phloroglucinol, pyrazole) with maximum exposure concentration selected based on mortality and/or solubility. Exposure to 3,4-dichloroaniline decreased the fluorescence signal. All goitrogenic compounds exhibited clear concentration-dependent inductions of reporter fluorescence 1.4 to 2.6 fold above control levels. Concentration-response modelling was used to calculate goitrogenic potencies based on {EC50} values. The new automated method offers an efficient screening approach for goitrogenic activity.}

abstract = {High-throughput imaging is applied to provide observations for accurate statements on phenomena in biology and this has been successfully applied in the domain of cells, i.e. cytomics. In the domain of whole organisms, we need to take the hurdles to ensure that the imaging can be accomplished with a sufficient throughput and reproducibility. For vertebrate biology, zebrafish is a popular model system for High-throughput applications. The development of the Vertebrate Automated Screening Technology ({VAST} {BioImager}), a microscope mounted system, enables the application of zebrafish high-throughput screening. The {VAST} {BioImager} contains a capillary that holds a zebrafish for imaging. Through the rotation of the capillary, multiple axial-views of a specimen can be acquired. For the {VAST} {BioImager}, fluorescence and/or confocal microscopes are used. Quantitation of a specific signal as derived from a label in one fluorescent channel requires insight in the zebrafish volume to be able to normalize quantitation to volume units. However, from the setup of the {VAST} {BioImager}, a specimen volume cannot be straightforwardly derived. We present a high-throughput axial-view imaging architecture based on the {VAST} {BioImager}. We propose profile-based {3D} reconstruction to produce {3D} volumetric representations for zebrafish larvae using the axial-views. Volume and surface area can then be derived from the {3D} reconstruction to obtain the shape characteristics in high-throughput measurements. In addition, we develop a calibration and a validation of our methodology. From our measurements we show that with a limited amount of views, accurate measurements of volume and surface area for zebrafish larvae can be obtained. We have applied the proposed method on a range of developmental stages in zebrafish and produced metrical references for the volume and surface area for each stage.}

abstract = {Unpredicted human safety events in clinical trials for new drugs are costly in terms of human health and money. The drug discovery industry attempts to minimize those events with diligent preclinical safety testing. Current standard practices are good at preventing toxic compounds from being tested in the clinic; however, false negative preclinical toxicity results are still a reality. Continual improvement must be pursued in the preclinical realm. Higher-quality therapies can be brought forward with more information about potential toxicities and associated mechanisms. The zebrafish model is a bridge between in vitro assays and mammalian in vivo studies. This model is powerful in its breadth of application and tractability for research. In the past two decades, our understanding of disease biology and drug toxicity has grown significantly owing to thousands of studies on this tiny vertebrate. This Review summarizes challenges and strengths of the model, discusses the {3Rs} value that it can deliver, highlights translatable and untranslatable biology, and brings together reports from recent studies with zebrafish focusing on new drug discovery toxicology.}

The recommendations provide guidance on best practices and ranges of husbandry parameters within which zebrafish welfare, as well as reproducibility of experimental procedures, are assured. Husbandry procedures found today in zebrafish facilities are numerous. While the vast majority of these practices are perfectly acceptable in terms of zebrafish physiology and welfare, the reproducibility of experimental results could be improved by further standardisation of husbandry procedures and exchange of husbandry information between laboratories. Standardisation protocols providing ranges of husbandry parameters are likely to be more successful and appropriate than the implementation of a set of fixed guidance values neglecting the empirically successful daily routines of many facilities and will better reflect the wide range of environmental parameters that characterise the natural habitats occupied by zebrafish. A joint working group on zebrafish housing and husbandry recommendations, with members of the European Society for Fish Models in Biology and Medicine ({EUFishBioMed}) and of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations ({FELASA}) has been given a mandate to provide guidelines based on a {FELASA} list of parameters, 'Terms of Reference'.}

Whereas current techniques have been optimized for imaging selected nonpigmented organs such as the mammalian brain, natural pigmentation remains challenging for most other biological specimens of larger volume. We have developed a fast {DEpigmEntation}-Plus-Clearing method ({DEEP}-Clear) that is easily incorporated in existing workflows and combines whole system labeling with a spectrum of detection techniques, ranging from immunohistochemistry to {RNA} in situ hybridization, labeling of proliferative cells ({EdU} labeling) and visualization of transgenic markers. With light-sheet imaging of whole animals and detailed confocal studies on pigmented organs, we provide unprecedented insight into eyes, whole nervous systems, and subcellular structures in animal models ranging from worms and squids to axolotls and zebrafish. {DEEP}-Clear thus paves the way for the exploration of species-rich clades and developmental stages that are largely inaccessible by regular imaging approaches.

Genetics lesions induced by single guide {RNA} ({gRNA}) are usually small indel (insertion-deletion) {DNA} mutations. The impact of this type of {CRISPR}-induced {DNA} mutation on the coded {mRNA} transcription processing and protein translation can be complex. Unexpected or unknown transcripts, generated through alternative splicing, may impede the generation of successful loss-of-function mutants. To create null or null-like loss-of-function mutant zebrafish, we employed simultaneous multiple {gRNA} injection into single-cell stage embryos. We demonstrated that {DNA} composed of multiple exons, up to 78kb in length, can be deleted in the smarca2 gene locus. Additionally, two different genes (rnf185 and rnf215) were successfully mutated in F1 fish with multiple exon deletions using this multiplex {gRNA} injection strategy. We expect this approach will be useful for knock-out studies in zebrafish and other vertebrate organisms, especially when the phenotype of a single {gRNA}-induced mutant is not clear.

The segmentation of the spatial frequency processes the depth information from multiple parallel projections, recombining the wave fields of different viewing directions in the Fourier domain. Segmented angular spectrum with layer based processing is introduced to calculate the partitioned elements, which effectively extends the limited region of conventional angular spectrum. The algorithm can provide accurate depth cues and is compatible with computer graphics rendering techniques to provide quality view-dependent properties. Experiments demonstrate the proposed method can reconstruct photorealistic {3D} images with accurate depth information.}

We showed that 18 out of the 33 {SW} and {WW} samples induced estrogenic responses in the {EASZY} assay leading to a significant and concentration-dependent up-regulation of the {ER}-regulated cyp19a1b gene expression in the developing brain. The in vivo 17\beta-estradiol-equivalents ({EEQs}) were highly correlated with, both, the chemical analytical risk quotient ({RQ}) based on steroidal estrogen concentrations and {EEQs} reported from five different in vitro reporter gene assays. Regression analyses between the vitro and in vivo effect concentrations allowed us to determine an optimal cut-off value for each in vitro assay, above which in vivo responses were observed. These in vitro assay-specific effect-based trigger values ({EBTs}), ranging from 0.28 to 0.58 ng {EEQ}/L define the sensitivity and specificity of the individual in vitro assays for predicting a risk associated with substances acting through the same mode of action in water samples. Altogether, this study demonstrates the toxicological relevance of in vitro-based assessment of estrogenic activity and recommends the use of such in vitro/in vivo comparative approach to refine and validate {EBTs} for mechanism-based bioassays.

Thirdly, all information is removed except the edge points. However, recognition points for recognizing the fish are appropriately left because there are only points left to distinguish between background and fish. Fourthly, the points are recognized as contour of the fish by using the local kernel regression method.

We propose an automatic lip segmentation technique for hyper-spectral images from an imaging prototype with medical applications. Contrarily to many other existing lip segmentation methods, we do not use colour space transformations to localise the lip area. As input image, we use for the first time a parametric blood concentration map computed by using narrow spectral bands. Our method mainly consists of three phases: (i) for each subject generate a subset of face images enhanced by different simulated Lambertian illuminations, then (ii) perform lip segmentation on each enhanced image by using constrained morphological operations, and finally (iii) extract features from Fourier-based modeled lip boundaries for selecting the lip candidate. Experiments for testing our approach are performed under controlled conditions on volunteers and on a public hyper-spectral dataset. Results show the effectiveness of the algorithm against low spectral range, moustache, and noise.}

We demonstrate the ability of the instrument to rapidly examine live specimens with minimal manual intervention by imaging fluorescent neutrophils over a nearly 0.3 mm3 volume in dozens of larval zebrafish. In addition to revealing considerable inter-individual variability in neutrophil number, known previously from labor-intensive methods, three-dimensional imaging allows assessment of the correlation between the bulk measure of total cellular fluorescence and the spatially resolved measure of actual neutrophil number per animal. We suggest that our simple experimental design should considerably expand the scope and impact of light sheet imaging in the life sciences.}

The {BBB} regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of {CNS} blood vessels constitute the {BBB}. {CNS} endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the {BBB}: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to {CNS} barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the {BBB}. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the {BBB} is an active process and {CNS}-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.

The constituent cells in the outer layer have copious smooth endoplasmic reticulum and are joined by gap junctions but have no desmosomes. The intermediate layer is thin, continuous, and single cell. In the replicas, both the upper and the lower surfaces of the intermediate layer cells have numerous openings of pinocytotic vesicles, but the upper surface is characterized by round gap junctions, whereas the lower surface is identified by a linear continuation of a combination of tight junctions and gap junctions and by desmosomes. The lateral surface has a hexagonal network of tight junctions and gap junctions with internally located desmosomes, which functions as a barrier to intercellular movement of lanthanum. The inner layer consists of a meshwork of reticular cells and large intercellular spaces, in which fine granular material, capillaries, and different types of blood-derived free cells can be found. Cells in the inner layer contain rough endoplasmic reticulum stacked in lamellae and have irregular processes joined by desmosomes. The goldfish meninges are compared with the meninges of mammals.}

The practicality and clinical suitability of four face shields printed using a fused deposition modeling printer were examined. The weight, printing time, and required tools for assembly were evaluated. To assess the clinical suitability, each face shield was worn for one hour by 10 clinicians and rated using a visual analogue scale. The filament weight (21-42 g) and printing time (1:40-3:17 h) differed significantly between the four frames. Likewise, the fit, wearing comfort, space for additional {PPE}, and protection varied between the designs. For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area. Consequently, two datasets are recommended.

abstract = {The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has caused a severe international shortage of the nasopharyngeal swabs that are required for collection of optimal specimens, creating a critical bottleneck blocking clinical laboratories' ability to perform high-sensitivity virological testing for {SARS}-{CoV}-2. To address this crisis, we designed and executed an innovative, cooperative, rapid-response translational-research program that brought together health care workers, manufacturers, and scientists to emergently develop and clinically validate new swabs for immediate mass production by {3D} printing. We performed a multistep preclinical evaluation of 160 swab designs and 48 materials from 24 companies, laboratories, and individuals, and we shared results and other feedback via a public data repository (http://github.com/rarnaout/Covidswab/). We validated four prototypes through an institutional review board ({IRB})-approved clinical trial that involved 276 outpatient volunteers who presented to our hospital's drive-through testing center with symptoms suspicious for {COVID}-19. Each participant was swabbed with a reference swab (the control) and a prototype, and {SARS}-{CoV}-2 reverse transcriptase {PCR} ({RT}-{PCR}) results were compared. All prototypes displayed excellent concordance with the control (\kappa = 0.85 to 0.89). Cycle threshold ({CT} ) values were not significantly different between each prototype and the control, supporting the new swabs' noninferiority (Mann-Whitney U [{MWU}] test, P \textgreater 0.05). Study staff preferred one of the prototypes over the others and preferred the control swab overall. The total time elapsed between identification of the problem and validation of the first prototype was 22 days. Contact information for ordering can be found at http://printedswabs.org Our experience holds lessons for the rapid development, validation, and deployment of new technology for this pandemic and beyond.

The {ILSI} Health and Environmental Sciences Institute and the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals ({ECETOC}) held an International Workshop on the Application of the Fish Embryo Test in March, 2008. This relatively young discipline is following advances in animal alternatives for human safety sciences, and it is advisable to develop a broad comparison of how animal alternative tests involving fish are viewed in a regulatory context over a wide array of authorities or advising bodies. These include {OECD}, Western Europe, North America, and Japan. This paper summarizes representative practices from these regions. Presently, the global regulatory environment has varying stances regarding the protection of fish for use as an experimental animal. Such differences have a long-term potential to lead to a lack of harmony in approaches to fish toxicity testing, especially for chemicals in commerce across multiple geographic regions. Implementation of alternative methods and approaches will be most successful if accepted globally, including methods of fish toxicity testing. An important area for harmonization would be in the interpretation of protected and nonprotected life stages of fish. Use of fish embryos represent a promising alternative and allow bridging to more technically challenging alternatives with longer prospective timelines, including cell-based assays, ecotoxicogenomics, and {QSARs}.

abstract = {In non-mammalian vertebrates, some neurons can regenerate after spinal cord injury. One of these, the giant Mauthner (M-) neuron shows a uniquely direct link to a robust survival-critical escape behavior but appears to regenerate poorly. Here we use two-photon microscopy in parallel with behavioral assays in zebrafish to show that the M-axon can regenerate very rapidly and that the recovery of functionality lags by just days. However, we also find that the site of the injury is critical: While regeneration is poor both close and far from the soma, rapid regeneration and recovery of function occurs for injuries between 10\% and 50\% of total axon length. Our findings show that rapid regeneration and the recovery of function can be studied at remarkable temporal resolution after targeted injury of one single M-axon and that the decision between poor and rapid regeneration can be studied in this one axon.}

abstract = {The smoking of tobacco continues to be the leading cause of premature death worldwide and is linked to the development of a number of serious illnesses including heart disease, respiratory diseases, stroke and cancer. Currently, cell line based toxicity assays are typically used to gain information on the general toxicity of cigarettes and other tobacco products. However, they provide little information regarding the complex disease-related changes that have been linked to smoking. The ethical concerns and high cost associated with mammalian studies have limited their widespread use for in vivo toxicological studies of tobacco. The zebrafish has emerged as a low-cost, high-throughput, in vivo model in the study of toxicology. In this study, smoke condensates from 2 reference cigarettes and 6 Canadian brands of cigarettes with different design features were assessed for acute, developmental, cardiac, and behavioural toxicity (neurotoxicity) in zebrafish larvae. By making use of this multifaceted approach we have developed an in vivo model with which to compare the toxicity profiles of smoke condensates from cigarettes with different design features. This model system may provide insights into the development of smoking related disease and could provide a cost-effective, high-throughput platform for the future evaluation of tobacco products.}

abstract = {Toxicity testing in the 21st century is moving toward using high-throughput screening assays to rapidly test thousands of chemicals against hundreds of molecular targets and biological pathways, and to provide mechanistic information on chemical effects in human cells and small model organisms. First-generation predictive models for prenatal developmental toxicity have revealed a complex web of biological processes with many connections to vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. This review examines disruption of embryonic vascular development as a potential adverse outcome pathway leading to developmental toxicity. We briefly review embryonic vascular development and important signals for vascular development (local growth factors and cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A and {TGF}-beta, components in the plasminogen activator system, and chemotactic chemokines). Genetic studies have shown that perturbing these signals can lead to varying degrees of adverse consequences, ranging from congenital angiodysplasia to fetal malformations and embryolethality. The molecular targets and cellular behaviors required for vascular development, stabilization and remodeling are amenable to in vitro evaluation. Evidence for chemical disruption of these processes is available for thalidomide, estrogens, endothelins, dioxin, retinoids, cigarette smoke, and metals among other compounds. Although not all compounds with developmental toxicity show an in vitro vascular bioactivity signature, many 'putative vascular disruptor compounds' invoke adverse developmental consequences. As such, an adverse outcome pathway perspective of embryonic vascular development can help identify useful information for assessing adverse outcomes relevant to risk assessment and efficient use of resources for validation.

abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated zebrafish as a useful high-throughput in vivo model to study the effects of cigarette smoke on early development. It has been shown previously that exposure of zebrafish to cigarette smoke total particulate matter ({TPM}) leads to several adverse physiological aberrations, including heart deformities and improper angiogenesis. Consequently, this study investigated the effects of {TPM} on cardiovascular development in zebrafish that were exposed to increasing concentrations of {TPM} based upon nicotine content from 6h post fertilization (hpf) up to 72hpf. We show that {TPM} exposure in wild-type embryos led to a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence, especially in the yolk and head regions, suggesting bioaccumulation of cyclic compounds in {TPM}, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}). Similarly, the incidence of cranial hemorrhage, pericardial edema, and string heart was increased with {TPM} exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, {TPM} exposure in transgenic (Flk1:{eGFP}) zebrafish showed a decrease in vascular abundance in the brain, but the transcript abundance of key angiogenic genes Tie-2, Angpt1, Notch3, and Flk1 remained largely unchanged and that of Vegf actually increased with {TPM}. The study also investigated aspects of a proposed crosstalk between the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ({AhR}) pathway and subsequent inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway, resulting in cardiac malformations. In an effort to reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular malformations, embryos/larvae were co-treated with {CHIR99021} ({CHIR}), which should promote Wnt signaling. However, co-treatment with {CHIR} did not significantly affect the {TPM}-induced cardiovascular toxicity. Overall, results from this study demonstrate that exposure to {TPM} leads to several cardiovascular deformities and disrupted vascular development in the brain, and that these effects are associated with downregulation of Wnt signaling.

abstract = {Curvilinear structure restoration in image processing procedures is a difficult task, which can be compounded when these structures are thin, i.e., when their smallest dimension is close to the resolution of the sensor. Many recent restoration methods involve considering a local gradient-based regularization term as prior, assuming gradient sparsity. An isotropic gradient operator is typically not suitable for thin curvilinear structures, since gradients are not sparse for these. In this paper, we propose a mixed gradient operator that combines a standard gradient in the isotropic image regions, and a directional gradient in the regions where specific orientations are likely. In particular, such information can be provided by curvilinear structure detectors (e.g., {RORPO} or Frangi filters). Our proposed mixed gradient operator, that can be viewed as a companion tool of such detectors, is proposed in a discrete framework and its formulation/computation holds in any dimension; in other words, it is valid in [Formula: see text], n ≥ 1 . We show how this mixed gradient can be used to construct image priors that take edge orientation, as well as intensity, into account, and then involved in various image processing tasks while preserving curvilinear structures. The experiments carried out on {2D}, {3D}, real, and synthetic images illustrate the relevance of the proposed gradient, and its use in variational frameworks for both denoising and segmentation tasks.}

One of the most challenging aspects of this problem is inferring the graph representation of the curvilinear network. Most existing delineation approaches first perform binary segmentation of the image and then refine it using either a set of hand-designed heuristics or a separate classifier that assigns likelihood to paths extracted from the pixel-wise prediction. In our work, we bridge the gap between segmentation and path classification by training a deep network that performs those two tasks simultaneously. We show that this approach is beneficial because it enforces consistency across the whole processing pipeline. We apply our approach on roads and neurons datasets.}

In this work, we propose a general unifying curvilinear structure segmentation network that works on different medical imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography angiography ({OCT}-A), color fundus image, and corneal confocal microscopy ({CCM}). Instead of the U-Net based convolutional neural network, we propose a novel network ({CS}-Net) which includes a self-attention mechanism in the encoder and decoder. Two types of attention modules are utilized - spatial attention and channel attention, to further integrate local features with their global dependencies adaptively. The proposed network has been validated on five datasets: two color fundus datasets, two corneal nerve datasets and one {OCT}-A dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, for example, sensitivities of corneal nerve fiber segmentation were at least 2\% higher than the competitors. As a complementary output, we made manual annotations of two corneal nerve datasets which have been released for public access.}

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) is a neurodegenerative disease targeting motor neurons which shows sexual dimorphism in its incidence, age of onset, and progression rate. All steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and progestogens, have been implicated in modulating {ALS}. Increasing evidence suggests that steroid hormones provide neuroprotective and neurotrophic support to motor neurons, either directly or via surrounding glial cell interactions, by activating their respective nuclear hormone receptors and initiating transcriptional regulatory responses. The {SOD1G93A} transgenic mouse also shows sex-specific differences in age of onset and progression, and remains the most widely used model in {ALS} research. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the influences of steroid hormone signaling in {ALS}, we systemically characterized sex hormone receptor expression at transcript and protein levels, cellular localization, and the impact of disease course in lumbar spinal cords of male and female {SOD1G93A} mice. We found that spinal motor neurons highly express nuclear androgen receptor ({AR}), estrogen receptor ({ER})\alpha, {ER\beta}, and progesterone receptor with variations in glial cell expression. {AR} showed the most robust sex-specific difference in expression and was downregulated in male {SOD1G93A} mouse spinal cord, in association with depletion in 5\alpha-reductase type 2 isoform, which primarily metabolizes testosterone to 5\alpha-dihydrotestosterone. {ER\alpha} was highly enriched in reactive astrocytes of {SOD1G93A} mice and {ER\beta} was strongly upregulated. The 5\alpha-reductase type 1 isoform was upregulated with disease progression and may influence local spinal cord hormone levels. In conclusion, steroid hormone receptor expression is dynamic and cell-type specific in {SOD1G93A} mice which may provide targets to modulate progression in {ALS}. \copyright Endocrine Society 2020.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative disorder. Mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) is a clinical precursor of {AD}. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for {AD}. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of {AD} is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in {AD}. To help {AD} diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network ({CNN}) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and {AD} classification using structural {MRI} data. Firstly, a multi-task deep {CNN} model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a {3D} Densely Connected Convolutional Networks ({3D} {DenseNet}) to learn features of the {3D} patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task {CNN} and {DenseNet} models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated on the baseline T1-weighted structural {MRI} data collected from 97 {AD}, 233 {MCI}, 119 Normal Control ({NC}) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}) database. The proposed method achieves a dice similarity coefficient of 87.0\% for hippocampal segmentation. In addition, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.9\% and an {AUC} (area under the {ROC} curve) of 92.5\% for classifying {AD} vs. {NC} subjects, and an accuracy of 76.2\% and an {AUC} of 77.5\% for classifying {MCI} vs. {NC} subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates that the proposed multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and several other competing methods. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Subjective scoring could impact results and be of particular concern when phenotypic effect patterns are also used as a diagnostic tool to classify compounds. Here we introduce a quantitative morphometric approach based on image analysis of zebrafish embryos. A software called {FishInspector} was developed to detect morphological features from images collected using an automated system to position zebrafish embryos. The analysis was verified and compared with visual assessments of 3 participating laboratories using 3 known developmental toxicants (methotrexate, dexamethasone, and topiramate) and 2 negative compounds (loratadine and glibenclamide). The quantitative approach exhibited higher sensitivity and made it possible to compare patterns of effects with the potential to establish a grouping and classification of developmental toxicants. Our approach improves the robustness of phenotype scoring and reliability of assay performance and, hence, is anticipated to improve the predictivity of developmental toxicity screening using the zebrafish embryo.}

Zebrafish are well suited for such investigations, but bona fide astrocytes have not been described in this system.

Zebrafish astrocytes associate closely with synapses, tile with one another and express markers, including Glast and glutamine synthetase. Once integrated into circuits, they exhibit whole-cell and microdomain Ca2+ transients, which are sensitive to norepinephrine. Finally, using a cell-specific {CRISPR}-Cas9 approach, we demonstrate that fgfr3 and fgfr4 are required for vertebrate astrocyte morphogenesis. This work provides the first visualization of astrocyte morphogenesis from stem cell to post-mitotic astrocyte in vivo, identifies a role for Fgf receptors in vertebrate astrocytes and establishes zebrafish as a valuable new model system to study astrocyte biology in vivo.}

abstract = {Atrazine is presently one of the most abundantly used herbicides in the United States, and a common contaminant of natural water bodies and drinking waters in high-use areas. Dysregulation of reproductive processes has been demonstrated in atrazine exposed fish, including alteration of key endocrine pathways on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal ({HPG}) axis. However, the potential for atrazine-induced transgenerational inheritance of reproductive effects in fish has not been investigated. The present study examined the effects of early developmental atrazine exposure on transgenerational reproductive dysregulation in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). F0 medaka were exposed to atrazine ({ATZ}, 5 or 50 μg/L), 17\alpha-ethinylestradiol ({EE2}, 0.002 or 0.05 μg/L), or solvent control during the first twelve days of development with no subsequent exposure over three generations. This exposure overlapped with the critical developmental window for embryonic germ cell development, gonadogenesis, and sex determination. Exposed males and females of the F0 generation were bred to produce an F1 generation, and this was continued until the F2 generation. Sperm count and motility were not affected in F0 males; however, both parameters were significantly reduced in the males from F2 Low {EE2} (0.002 μg/L), Low {ATZ} (5 μg/L), and High {ATZ} (50 μg/L) lineages. Fecundity was unaffected by atrazine or {EE2} in F0 through F2 generations; however, fertilization rate was decreased in low atrazine and {EE2} exposure lineages in the F2 generation. There were significant transgenerational differences in expression of the genes involved in steroidogenesis and {DNA} methylation. These results suggest that although early life exposure to atrazine did not cause significant phenotypes in the directly exposed F0 generation, subsequent generations of fish were at greater risk of reproductive dysfunction.

The {MEOGRT} test design was used to evaluate the multigenerational effects of the antimicrobial agent triclosan. Japanese medaka were exposed to nominal concentrations of 1.4, 2.8, 5.6, 11, and 23 μg/L triclosan and a dilution water control starting with adult medaka (F0) through hatch in the second generation (F2). No consistent or concentration-related responses occurred in the 182-d test that suggested an endocrine-mediated effect. There were no impacts on hepatic vitellogenin, secondary sex characteristics, or sex ratio that were linked to an adverse reproductive outcome. Histopathological responses were consistent with a toxic or stress effect, particularly when considered in context with observed reductions in growth. The overall population-relevant no-observed-effect concentration was 11 \mug/L based on effects on growth. The results of the present study support a previously conducted weight-of-evidence evaluation concluding that triclosan does not act as an agonist or antagonist within estrogen, androgen, thyroid, or steroidogenic pathways.

Embryos (1-day postfertilization) and larvae (2-day posthatch) were exposed to {OXY} (0.5-8 mg/L) for 96 h and evaluated for mortality and hatching on embryos, and the mortality and growth on larvae during depuration. It was observed that the embryo-mortality was inconsistently altered by {OXY}; only the 2 mg/L group showed significant reduction on embryo survivability. However, larval-mortality was concentration-dependent and {OXY} exposure induced scoliosis-like phenotypic features in the surviving larvae; the calculated {LC50} was 5.238 mg/L. Our data further indicated that larval skeleton, both axial and appendicular, was the potential target site of {OXY}. Skeletal growth in larvae exposed to 2 mg/L was inhibited significantly until 1 week of depuration with regard to the linear lengths of neurocranium, Meckel's cartilage, caudal vertebrae (first 10) in the axial skeletons, and pectoral fin and urostyle in the appendicular skeletons. Moreover, the total protein content remained unaltered by {OXY} after 96 h exposure; while the {RNA} concentration was reduced significantly in larvae exposed to 2 mg/L. Expression analysis of several genes by quantitative real-time {RT}-{PCR} ({RT}-{qPCR}) showed significant upregulation of zic5, a zinc-finger type transcription regulator, at the transcription level. This study indicated that the scoliosis induced by {OXY} in Japanese medaka larvae was the result of stunted skeletal growth, probably because of deregulation of zinc-finger type transcription regulators, at the genomic level. \copyright 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

The results showed that phenanthrene significantly prolonged the time to hatch for embryos. Other parameters such as fecundity and fertility, organ-somatic ratios, hepatic vitellogenin production, and the histology of testes and ovaries were not different between the control and phenanthrene-treated groups.

A number of unique features and established resources distinguish medaka from other vertebrate model systems. A large number of laboratory strains from different locations are available. Due to a high tolerance to inbreeding, many highly inbred strains have been established, thus providing a rich resource for genetic studies. Furthermore, closely related species native to different habitats in Southeast Asia permit comparative evolutionary studies. The transparency of embryos, larvae, and juveniles allows a detailed in vivo analysis of development. New tools to study diverse aspects of medaka biology are constantly being generated. Thus, medaka has become an important vertebrate model organism to study development, behavior, and physiology. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of established genetic and molecular-genetic tools that render medaka fish a full-fledged vertebrate system.

To test the hypothesis that {BF} impairs sex differentiation, larval Japanese Medaka were exposed to {BF} during a critical developmental window for phenotypic sexual differentiation. Fish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of {BF} (0.15 μg/L and 1.5 μg/L), a single concentration (0.3 mg/L) of an estrogen receptor ({ER}) antagonist ({ICI} 182,780), and an {ER} agonist (0.2 ug/L) (17\beta-estradiol). Fish were exposed at 8 days post hatch (dph) larvae for 30 days. Phenotypic sex, secondary sexual characteristics ({\SSC}) and genotypic sex were investigated at sexual maturity (8 weeks). A trend towards masculinization (p = 0.06) based on the presence of papillary processes in anal fin rays of Japanese Medaka was observed in fish exposed to the lowest concentration of {BF}. However, genotypic gender ratios were not altered. These results show sex differentiation was not significantly altered by larval exposure to {BF} in Japanese medaka.

In medaka, Forkhead box L3 (foxl3) was previously identified as a germ cell-intrinsic regulator of sex determination that suppresses the initiation of spermatogenesis in female germ cells. To reveal the molecular mechanism of germline sex determination by foxl3, we conducted the following four analyses: Comparison of transcriptomes between wild-type and foxl3-mutant germ cells; epistatic analysis; identification of the {FOXL3}-binding motif; and {ChIP}-{qPCR} assay using a {FOXL3}-monoclonal antibody. We identified two candidate genes acting downstream of foxl3: Rec8a and fbxo47. It has been known that Rec8 regulates sister chromatid cohesion and Fbxo47 acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. These functions have not been, however, associated with sexual differentiation in germ cells. Our results uncover novel components acting downstream of foxl3, providing insights into the mechanism of germline sex determination. Copyright \copyright 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Fish behaviors have great potential as models for the study of pharmacology, genetics, and neuroscience. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) are popular freshwater animal models. However, their behavioral use in aquatic toxicology research is generally hampered by oversimplified behavioral tasks and the fact that they are not well-developed animal models for toxicology. Here, this study presented a comparative analysis of multiple behavioral traits (i.e., anxiety-like behavior, novel object recognition, social preferences, habituation to light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus, and spatial learning and memory). We found that only medaka (d-{rR}) presented a weak or no response to repeated light-dark stimulus and noise stimulus. In addition, no significant behavioral changes were observed for the three species of juvenile fish models after 7 days of exposure to 0.01\% v/v carrier solvents (i.e., ethanol, acetone, and {DMSO}). In contrast to zebrafish and Chinese rare minnow, medaka showed no significant changes in spatial memory after subacute exposure to 1 mg/L imidacloprid or 2.5 μg/L chlorpyrifos (cpf); instead, a hyperactivity response in the open field test and reduced social time were induced by cpf and imidacloprid, respectively. Our results suggest that: (1) behavioral effects are negligible when using \textless 0.01\% v/v carrier solvents for behavioral assessment; (2) given the differences in sensitivities of behavioral responses, a single behavior used alone as an endpoint may be insufficient for estimating the toxic impacts of pesticides or other environmental contaminants. In conclusion, these results could have major implications for aquatic toxicology research and water quality monitoring and ecotoxicological risk assessment. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Vertebrate reproduction involves complex steroid hormone interplay and inter-conversion. A critical element in maintaining sex steroid levels is the enzyme aromatase (cytochrome P450 {19A1}) which converts androgens to oestrogens. In turn oestrogen signalling is targeted by numerous chemicals, from pharmaceuticals to agricultural chemicals, both frequent sources of contamination in waste waters and consequently rivers. Although many models are now available to address disruption of oestrogen signalling, there are currently no published protocols allowing discrimination between alterations in testosterone metabolism and in oestrogenic signalling. It was with this limitation in mind that we optimised this protocol. We show using a 48h protocol that pre-feeding fry of the choriogenin h-gfp (chgh-gfp) medaka line are sensitive to 0.{05nM} {EE2} (15ng/L), within the range of the lowest published observable physiological effect concentrations for medaka. In addition, co-treatment with testosterone can reveal potential effects of test substances on aromatase enzymatic activity. As the measurements are visualised in real-time without affecting embryo viability, repeated measures are possible. We demonstrate the ability of this model to detect oestrogen receptor agonists, aromatisable androgens, P450 aromatase activity modulators and selective oestrogen response modulators. Importantly, the range of this assay is physiologically relevant. Copyright \copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

This study analyses literature {SR} data and discusses important considerations for using {SR} data in the regulatory context for the hazard identification, classification, {PBT} (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) assessment, testing, and risk assessment. A total number of 106 studies were compiled for {SR} of zebrafish, medaka and fathead minnow exposed to 84 chemicals or mixtures. About 53\% of literature studies determined {SR} by methods different from the standard histology method, leading to uncertainty of quantifying {SR} and differential sensitivity. {SR} was determined after depuration in 40 papers, which may lead to chemical-induced {SR} changes reversible to the control. {SR} was responsive to chemicals with {EAS} (estrogen, androgen, steoroidogenesis) activity and also to those with thyroid and progesterone activity. Besides, {SR} was influenced by non-chemical factors, e.g., inbreeding and temperature, leading to difficulty in data interpretation. The {ECHA}/{EFSA}/{JRC} Guidance suggests that {SR} and gonad histology data can be used for identifying {EDCs}. Due to reversibility, influence of confounding factors, and responsiveness to chemicals with endocrine activity other than {EAS}, this study suggests that {SR}/gonad histology should be combined with certain mode of action evidence for identifying {EDCs}. Important considerations for using {SR} data in the identification, classification, {PBT} assessment, testing, and risk assessment are discussed. Copyright \copyright 2019 The Authors.

In the present study, the multigenerational endocrine disrupting potential of {PFBS} was investigated by exposing F0 marine medaka eggs to {PFBS} at different concentrations (0, 1.0, 2.9, and 9.5 μg/L) until sexual maturity. The F1 and F2 generations were reared without continued exposure. Thyroidal disturbances were examined in all three generations. {PFBS} exposure decreased the levels of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) in F0 female blood; however, it increased T3 or thyroxine (T4) levels in F0 brains, in which hyperthyroidism suppressed the local transcription of 5'-deiodinase 2 ( Dio2). Obviously decreased T3 was transferred to F1 eggs, although the parental influences were reversed in F1 larvae. Delayed hatching was coupled with elevated T3 levels in F1 larvae. F1 adults showed comparable symptoms of thyroidal disruption with F0 adults. A slight recovery was noted in the F2 generation, although F2 larvae still exhibited thyroid disruption and synthesized excessive T4. Our results suggested that the offspring suffered more severe dysfunction of the thyroidal axis albeit without direct exposure. This study provided the first molecular insight about {PFBS} toxicology on the thyroid, beneficial to both human and environmental risk assessment.}

As the {UPR} is considered to be involved in the development and progression of various diseases, as well as in the survival and growth of tumor cells, {UPR} inhibitors have been sought. To date, {IRE1} inhibitors have been screened using cell-based reporter assays and fluorescent-based in vitro cleavage assays. Here, we used medaka fish to develop an in vivo assay for {IRE1\alpha} inhibitors. {IRE1\alpha}, {IRE1\beta}, {ATF6\alpha} and {ATF6\beta} are ubiquitously expressed in medaka. We found that {IRE1\alpha}/{ATF6\alpha}-double knockout is lethal, similarly to {IRE1\alpha}/{IRE1\beta}- and {ATF6\alpha}/{ATF6\beta}-double knockout. Therefore, {IRE1} inhibitors are expected to confer lethality to {ATF6\alpha}-knockout medaka but not to wild-type medaka. One compound named K114 was obtained from 1,280 compounds using this phenotypic screening. K114 inhibited {ER} stress-induced splicing of {XBP1} {mRNA} as well as reporter luciferase expression in {HCT116} cells derived from human colorectal carcinoma, and inhibited ribonuclease activity of human {IRE1\alpha} in vitro. Thus, this phenotypic assay can be used as a quick test for the efficacy of {IRE1\alpha} inhibitors in vivo.Key words: endoplasmic reticulum, inhibitor screening, {mRNA} splicing, phenotypic assay, unfolded protein response.}

abstract = {Chemical exposure during embryonic development may cause persistent effects, yet developmental toxicity data exist for very few chemicals. Current testing procedures are time consuming and costly, underlining the need for rapid and low cost screening strategies. While in vitro methods are useful for screening, these methods do not replicate all the intricacies of embryonic development and should ideally be complemented by an in vivo screening strategy. In this study, we modify a medaka fish embryo assay to meet the requirements of high-throughput, developmental toxicant testing in vivo. The Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) offers several advantages over traditional mammalian model systems, including economic husbandry, high fecundity, and rapid ex utero development. In most studies where fish eggs are exposed to a chemical, the exposure takes place in a common vessel, with many embryos being exposed to the same solution. This type of design is not amenable to high-throughput methodology, does not allow the investigator to follow the same embryo throughout gestation, and may confound statistical analysis of the results. Therefore, we developed a 96-well microtiter plate method to facilitate exposure of individual medaka embryos in single wells and compared this approach to the common vessel method using the industrial solvent dimethyl sulfoxide ({DMSO}) as the test compound. At lower {DMSO} concentrations (0\% or 1\%), the 96-well microtiter plate assay replicated results obtained using the common vessel exposure method. There was, however, increased lethality and decreased hatching rate in the bottle-reared embryos treated with the higher {DMSO} concentrations (5\% or 10\%). Because the embryos reared in the 96-well microtiter plates never showed increased adverse effects (as compared to the bottle-reared embryos) at any {DMSO} concentration, we conclude that the 96-well microtiter plate assay provides a rapid and efficient alternative for developmental toxicity screens that utilize fish embryos.}

Automatically acquired bright-field data feeds into an easy-to-use {HeartBeat} software with graphical user interface for automated quantification of heart rate and rhythm. Sensitivity of the assay was demonstrated by profiling heart rates during entire embryonic development. Our analysis revealed rapid adaption of heart rates to temperature changes, which has implications for standardization of experimental layout. The assay allows scoring of multiple embryos per well enabling a throughput of \textgreater500 embryos per 96-well plate. In a proof of principle screen for compound testing, we captured concentration-dependent effects of nifedipine and terfenadine over time. Our novel assay permits large-scale applications ranging from phenotypic screening, interrogation of gene functions to cardiovascular drug development.}

abstract = {Fish embryo models are widely used as screening tools to assess the efficacy and/or toxicity of chemicals. This assessment involves the analysis of embryo morphological abnormalities. In this article, we propose a multi-scale pipeline to allow automated classification of fish embryos (Medaka: Oryzias latipes) based on the presence or absence of spine malformations. The proposed pipeline relies on the acquisition of fish embryo {2D} images, on feature extraction based on mathematical morphology operators and on machine learning classification. After image acquisition, segmentation tools are used to detect the embryo before analysing several morphological features. An approach based on machine learning is then applied to these features to automatically classify embryos according to the presence of axial malformations. We built and validated our learning model on 1459 images with a 10-fold cross-validation by comparison with the gold standard of {3D} observations performed under a microscope by a trained operator. Our pipeline results in correct classification in 85\% of the cases included in the database. This percentage is similar to the percentage of success of a trained human operator working on {2D} images. The key benefit of our approach is the low computational cost of our image analysis pipeline, which guarantees optimal throughput analysis. Copyright \copyright 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}

Presenting flashes of light to the ipsilateral eye causes that ipsilateral axon to fire, whereas stimulating the contralateral eye excites all other {RGC} inputs to the tectum. We performed time-lapse imaging of individual ipsilaterally projecting axons while stimulating either the ipsilateral or contralateral eye. Stimulating either eye alone reduced axon elaboration by increasing branch loss. New branch additions in the ipsi axon were exclusively increased by contralateral eye stimulation, which was enhanced by expressing tetanus neurotoxin ({TeNT}) in the ipsilateral axon, to prevent Hebbian stabilization. Together, our results reveal the existence of a non-cell-autonomous "Stentian" signal, engaged by activation of neighboring {RGCs}, that promotes exploratory axon branching in response to noncorrelated firing.

Although vertebrate eye development and retinogenesis are well characterized, the mechanisms that can initiate {RPC} proliferation following injury-induced regrowth and repair remain unknown. This is partly because endogenous {RPC} proliferation typically occurs during embryogenesis while studies of retinal regeneration have largely utilized adult (or mature) models. We found that embryos of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, successfully regrew functional eyes after ablation. The initiation of regrowth induced a robust {RPC} proliferative response with a concomitant delay of the endogenous {RPC} differentiation program. During eye regrowth, overall embryonic development proceeded normally. Here, we provide a protocol to study regrowth-dependent {RPC} proliferation in vivo. This system represents a robust and low-cost strategy to rapidly define fundamental mechanisms that regulate regrowth-initiated {RPC} proliferation, which will facilitate progress in identifying promising strategies for productive eye repair.}

In Xenopus the regenerated lens is derived de novo from cells located within the basal-most layer of the larval corneal epithelium, and is triggered by factors provided by the neural retina. In larval frogs the corneal epithelium is underlain by an endothelium separated from the corneal epithelium except for a small central attachment (i.e., the "stromal-attracting center"). This connection grows larger as the stroma forms and the frogs approach metamorphosis.

However, to facilitate the shift in reliance on apical effects for risk assessment to predictive surrogate metrics having characterized linkages to chemical mechanisms of action, targeted in vivo testing is necessary to establish these predictive relationships. In this study, we demonstrate a means to predict thyroid-related metamorphic success in the model amphibian Xenopus laevis using relevant biochemical measurements during early prometamorphosis. The adverse outcome pathway for thyroperoxidase inhibition leading to altered amphibian metamorphosis was used to inform a pathway-based in vivo study design that generated response-response relationships. These causal relationships were used to develop Bayesian probabilistic network models that mathematically determine conditional dependencies between biochemical nodes and support the predictive capability of the biochemical profiles. Plasma thyroxine concentrations were the most predictive of metamorphic success with improved predictivity when thyroid gland sodium-iodide symporter gene expression levels (a compensatory response) were used in conjunction with plasma thyroxine as an additional regressor. Although thyroid-mediated amphibian metamorphosis has been studied for decades, this is the first time a predictive relationship has been characterized between plasma thyroxine and metamorphic success. Linking these types of biochemical surrogate metrics to apical outcomes is vital to facilitate the transition to the new paradigm of chemical safety assessments.

abstract = {Thyroid hormones ({THs}) play critical roles in profound changes in many vertebrates, notably in mammalian neurodevelopment, although the precise molecular mechanisms of these fundamental biological processes are still being unravelled. Environmental and health concerns prompted the development of chemical safety testing and, in the context of endocrine disruption, identification of thyroid hormone axis disrupting chemicals ({THADCs}) remains particularly challenging. As various molecules are known to interfere with different levels of {TH} signalling, screening tests for {THADCs} may not rely solely on in vitro ligand/receptor binding to {TH} receptors. Therefore, alternatives to mammalian in vivo assays featuring {TH}-related endpoints that are more sensitive than circulatory {THs} and more rapid than thyroid histopathology are needed to fulfil the ambition of higher throughput screening of the myriad of environmental chemicals. After a detailed introduction of the context, we have listed current assays and parameters to assess thyroid disruption following a literature search of recent publications referring to non-mammalian models. Potential {THADCs} were mostly investigated in zebrafish and the frog Xenopus laevis, an amphibian model extensively used to study {TH} signalling. Copyright \copyright 2020.

The present study chose the Xenopus laevis tadpole as a model to assess the thyroid endocrine disruption as well as the lipid metabolic disturbance of {GO}. Tadpoles at the 51 stage were exposed to {GO} (0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/L) for 21 days, when tadpoles were undergoing an extremely complicated phase of morphological changes and growth. {GO} treatment showed obvious developmental toxicity, such as shortened snout-to-vent length ({SVL}) and hind limb length ({HLL}), decreased body weight, and delayed developmental stage. Exposure to {GO} also induced obvious decreases in whole-body triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxin (T4) concentrations. The {mRNA} expression of genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid ({HPT}) axis also changed significantly. Furthermore, we observed significant decline in the fatty acids and triglycerides ({TGs}) concomitantly with changes in the expression of genes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of lipids in {GO} exposure groups. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) and total bile acid levels increased remarkably, but cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein ({LDH}) levels showed no obvious changes. Taken together, the results revealed for the first time that {GO} could induce thyroid endocrine disruption and produce obvious disturbance effect on lipid synthesis and metabolism.

abstract = {Organotin compounds are the ubiquitous environmental pollutants due to their wide industrial and agricultural applications and unexpected releasing into the environment, which show characteristic of endocrine disruptors to interfere with the synthesis, receptor binding or action of endogenous-hormones. Organotin pesticides ({OTPs}) are used in agriculture and may impact endocrine functions on organisms. Thyroid hormones ({THs}) play fundamental roles in regulating the basal metabolism and energy balance, while thyroid function can be impaired by environmental contaminants. Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the effects and mechanisms of {OTPs} on hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid ({HPT}) axis. In this study, Xenopus laevis tadpoles at stage 51 were exposed to fentin hydroxide and fenbutatin oxide (0.04, 0.20 and 1.00 μg·L-1) for 21 days. It was found that both compounds caused inhibitory effects on metamorphic development of tadpoles (e.g., significant decrease in hindlimb length and retarding development). Triiodothyronine (T3) significantly decreased in tadpoles exposed to 0.20 μg/L and 1.00 μg/L of the two {OTPs} for 14 days or 21 days. The expressions of {TH} responsive genes tr\beta, bteb and dio2 were down-regulated, while tsh\beta and slc5a5 were up-regulated. Surface plasmon resonance ({SPR}) binding assays showed that fentin hydroxide had a moderate affinity to recombinant human thyroid hormone receptor \beta but fenbutatin oxide did not have. Result of the {SPR} assay was highly consistent with the luciferase reporter gene assays that fentin hydroxide suppressed the relative luciferase activity in the presence of T3 while fenbutatin oxide did not, demonstrating fentin hydroxide but not fenbutatin oxide displayed an antagonistic activity against T3-{TR} complex mediated transcriptional activation. Overall, the findings elucidated the mechanisms induced by {OTPs} along {HPT} axis. These results highlighted the adverse influences of organotin pesticides on thyroid hormone- dependent development in vertebrates and the need for more comprehensive investigations of their potential ecological risks.

Up-regulated genes whose function can be predicted on the basis of their sequence include four transcription factors (including one of the thyroid hormone receptors), an extracellular matrix component (fibronectin) and membrane receptor (integrin), four proteinases, a deiodinase that degrades thyroid hormone, and a protein that binds the hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor, which has been implicated in controlling thyroid hormone synthesis in Xenopus tadpoles. All four down-regulated genes encode extracellular proteins that are expressed in tadpole epidermis. This survey of the program provides insights into the biology of metamorphosis.}

abstract = {Genetic engineering is the use of molecular biology technology to modify {DNA} sequence(s) in genomes, using a variety of approaches. For example, homologous recombination can be used to target specific sequences in mouse embryonic stem ({ES}) cell genomes or other cultured cells, but it is cumbersome, poorly efficient, and relies on drug positive/negative selection in cell culture for success. Other routinely applied methods include random integration of {DNA} after direct transfection (microinjection), transposon-mediated {DNA} insertion, or {DNA} insertion mediated by viral vectors for the production of transgenic mice and rats. Random integration of {DNA} occurs more frequently than homologous recombination, but has numerous drawbacks, despite its efficiency. The most elegant and effective method is technology based on guided endonucleases, because these can target specific {DNA} sequences. Since the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats or {CRISPR}/Cas9 technology, endonuclease-mediated gene targeting has become the most widely applied method to engineer genomes, supplanting the use of zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and meganucleases. Future improvements in {CRISPR}/Cas9 gene editing may be achieved by increasing the efficiency of homology-directed repair. Here, we describe principles of genetic engineering and detail: (1) how common elements of current technologies include the need for a chromosome break to occur, (2) the use of specific and sensitive genotyping assays to detect altered genomes, and (3) delivery modalities that impact characterization of gene modifications. In summary, while some principles of genetic engineering remain steadfast, others change as technologies are ever-evolving and continue to revolutionize research in many fields.}

Spot irradiation could induce locus-specific recombination noninvasively, enabling us to compare phenotypes on the left and right sides in the same mouse. Furthermore, long-term irradiation using an implanted wireless {LED} substantially improved Cre recombination activity, especially in the brain.

abstract = {Filamin C ({FLNc}) is mainly expressed in striated muscle cells where it localizes to Z-discs, myotendinous junctions and intercalated discs. Recent studies have revealed numerous mutations in the {FLNC} gene causing familial and sporadic myopathies and cardiomyopathies with marked clinical variability. The most frequent myopathic mutation, p.{W2710X}, which is associated with myofibrillar myopathy, deletes the carboxy-terminal 16 amino acids from {FLNc} and abolishes the dimerization property of Ig-like domain 24. We previously characterized "knock-in" mice heterozygous for this mutation (p.{W2711X}), and have now investigated homozygous mice using protein and {mRNA} expression analyses, mass spectrometry, and extensive immunolocalization and ultrastructural studies. Although the latter mice display a relatively mild myopathy under normal conditions, our analyses identified major mechanisms causing the pathophysiology of this disease: in comparison to wildtype animals (i) the expression level of {FLNc} protein is drastically reduced; (ii) mutant {FLNc} is relocalized from Z-discs to particularly mechanically strained parts of muscle cells, i.e. myotendinous junctions and myofibrillar lesions; (iii) the number of lesions is greatly increased and these lesions lack Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 ({BAG3}) protein; (iv) the expression of heat shock protein beta-7 ({HSPB7}) is almost completely abolished. These findings indicate grave disturbances of {BAG3}-dependent and -independent autophagy pathways that are required for efficient lesion repair. In addition, our studies reveal general mechanisms of lesion formation and demonstrate that defective {FLNc} dimerization via its carboxy-terminal domain does not disturb assembly and basic function of myofibrils. An alternative, more amino-terminally located dimerization site might compensate for that loss. Since filamins function as stress sensors, our data further substantiate that {FLNc} is important for mechanosensing in the context of Z-disc stabilization and maintenance.}

For {\sigma1R} binding, {OF}-{NB1} and {MF}-{NB1} exhibited Ki values of 410 {nM} and 2700 {nM}, respectively. {OF}-{NB1}, which outperformed {MF}-{NB1}, was radiolabeled with {18F} to afford {18F}-{OF}-{NB1} in \textgreater 95\% radiochemical purity and molar activities of 192±33 {GBq}/μmol. In autoradiography experiments, {18F}-{OF}-{NB1} displayed a heterogeneous and specific binding in {GluN2B} subunit-rich brain regions such as the cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus. {PET} imaging studies in Wistar rats showed a similar heterogeneous uptake, and no brain radiometabolites were detected. A dose-dependent blocking effect was observed with {CP}-101,606 (0.5-15 mg/kg) and resulted in a D50 of 8.1 \mumol/kg. Postmortem autoradiography results revealed a lower expression level of the {GluN2B} subunits in {ALS} brain tissue sections compared to healthy controls, in line with immunohistochemistry results. Conclusion:{18F}-{OF}-{NB1} is a highly promising {PET} imaging probe for imaging the {GluN2B} subunits of the {NMDAR}. It possesses utility for receptor occupancy studies and has potential for {PET} imaging studies in {ALS} patients and possibly other brain disorders.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Pathological forms of {TAR} {DNA}-binding protein 43 ({TDP}-43) are present in motor neurons of almost all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) patients, and mutations in {TDP}-43 are also present in {ALS}. Loss and gain of {TDP}-43 functions are implicated in pathogenesis, but the mechanisms are unclear. While the {RNA} functions of {TDP}-43 have been widely investigated, its {DNA} binding roles remain unclear. However, recent studies have implicated a role for {TDP}-43 in the {DNA} damage response. {METHODS}: We used {NSC}-34 motor neuron-like cells and primary cortical neurons expressing wildtype {TDP}-43 or {TDP}-43 {ALS} associated mutants ({A315T}, {Q331K}), in which {DNA} damage was induced by etoposide or {H2O2} treatment. We investigated the consequences of depletion of {TDP}-43 on {DNA} repair using small interfering {RNAs}. Specific non homologous end joining ({NHEJ}) reporters ({EJ5GFP} and {EJ2GFP}) and cells lacking {DNA}-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase ({DNA}-{PK}) were used to investigate the role of {TDP}-43 in {DNA} repair. To investigate the recruitment of {TDP}-43 to sites of {DNA} damage we used single molecule super-resolution microscopy and a co-immunoprecipitation assay. We also investigated {DNA} damage in an {ALS} transgenic mouse model, in which {TDP}-43 accumulates pathologically in the cytoplasm. We also examined fibroblasts derived from {ALS} patients bearing the {TDP}-43 {M337V} mutation for evidence of {DNA} damage. {RESULTS}: We demonstrate that wildtype {TDP}-43 is recruited to sites of {DNA} damage where it participates in classical {NHEJ} {DNA} repair. However, {ALS}-associated {TDP}-43 mutants lose this activity, which induces {DNA} damage. Furthermore, {DNA} damage is present in mice displaying {TDP}-43 pathology, implying an active role in neurodegeneration. Additionally, {DNA} damage triggers features typical of {TDP}-43 pathology; cytoplasmic mis-localisation and stress granule formation. Similarly, inhibition of {NHEJ} induces {TDP}-43 mis-localisation to the cytoplasm. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study reveals that {TDP}-43 functions in {DNA} repair, but loss of this function triggers {DNA} damage and is associated with key pathological features of {ALS}.}

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species ({ROS})-induced neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathologic factor in sporadic Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Neuronal mitochondria have been proposed to be a promising therapeutic target for {AD}, especially for the failures of phase {III} clinical trials on conventional amyloid-\beta (A\beta) targeted therapy. However, the efficient intravenous delivery of therapeutic agents to neuronal mitochondria in the brain remains a major challenge due to the complicated physiological environment. Recently, biomaterials-based nanomedicine has been widely investigated for the treatment of {AD}. Herein, we devised a strategy for functional antioxidant delivery to neuronal mitochondria by loading antioxidants into red blood cell ({RBC}) membrane-coated nanostructured lipid carriers ({NLC}) bearing rabies virus glycoprotein ({RVG29}) and triphenylphosphine cation ({TPP}) molecules attached to the {RBC} membrane surface ({RVG}/{TPP} {NPs}@{RBCm}). With the advantage of suitable physicochemical properties of {NLC} and unique biological functions of the {RBC} membrane, {RVG}/{TPP} {NPs}@{RBCm} are stabilized and enabled sustained drug release, providing improved biocompatibility and long-term circulation. Under the synergistic effects of {RVG29} and {TPP}, {RVG}/{TPP} {NPs}@{RBCm} can not only penetrate the blood-brain barrier ({BBB}) but also target neuron cells and further localize in the mitochondria. After encapsulating Resveratrol ({RSV}) as the model antioxidant, the data demonstrated that {RVG}/{TPP}-{RSV} {NPs}@{RBCm} can relieve {AD} symptoms by mitigating A\beta-related mitochondrial oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. The memory impairment in {APP}/{PS1} mice is significantly improved following the systemic administration of {RVG}/{TPP}-{RSV} {NPs}@{RBCm}. In conclusion, intravenous neuronal mitochondria-targeted dual-modified novel biomimetic nanosystems are a promising therapeutic candidate for {ROS}-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in {AD}.}

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that accounts for a majority of dementia cases. {AD} is characterized by progressive neuronal death associated with neuropathological lesions consisting of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. While the pathogenesis of {AD} has been widely investigated, significant gaps in our knowledge remain about the cellular and molecular mechanisms promoting {AD}. Recent studies have highlighted the role of {DNA} damage, particularly {DNA} double-strand breaks ({DSBs}), in the progression of neuronal loss in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that accumulation of {DNA} {DSB} plays an important role in {AD} pathogenesis. To test our hypothesis, we examined {DNA} {DSB} expression and {DNA} repair function in the hippocampus of human {AD} and non-{AD} brains by immunohistochemistry, {ELISA}, and {RT}-{qPCR}. We observed increased {DNA} {DSB} accumulation and reduced {DNA} repair function in the hippocampus of {AD} brains compared to the non-{AD} control brains. Next, we found significantly increased levels of {DNA} {DSB} and altered levels of {DNA} repair proteins in the hippocampus of {5xFAD} mice compared to non-transgenic mice. Interestingly, increased accumulation of {DNA} {DSBs} and altered {DNA} repair proteins were also observed in cellular models of {AD}. These findings provided compelling evidence that {AD} is associated with accumulation of {DNA} {DSB} and/or alteration in {DSB} repair proteins which may influence an important early part of the pathway toward neural damage and memory loss in {AD}.}

To elucidate this role in an animal {AD} model, we assessed cognitive function of 4-month-old five familial {AD} ({5XFAD}) transgenic (Tg) mice using a learning strategy-switching task requiring recruitment of the frontal cortex and measuring levels of 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal (4-{HNE}), a marker of oxidative stress, in their frontal cortex. Mice were sequentially trained in cued/response and place/spatial versions of the water maze task for four days each. {5XFAD} and non-Tg mice exhibited equal performance in cued/response training. However, {5XFAD} mice used spatial search strategy less than non-Tg mice in the spatial/place training. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence staining showed that 4-{HNE} levels increased in the frontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus and striatum, of {5XFAD} mice compared to those in non-Tg mice. We report early cognitive deficits related to the frontal cortex and the frontal cortex's oxidative damage in 4-month-old {5XFAD} mice. These results suggest that 4-month-old {5XFAD} mice be a useful animal model for the early diagnosis and management of {AD}.}

Less appreciated is the fact that {HD} patients also exhibit cardiac and respiratory dysfunction including pulmonary insufficiency and cardiac arrhythmias. The underlying mechanism for these symptoms is poorly understood. In the present study we provide insight into the cause of cardiorespiratory dysfunction in {HD} and identify a novel therapeutic target. We now show that intracellular calcium (Ca2+) leak via post-translationally modified ryanodine receptor/intracellular calcium release ({RyR}) channels plays an important role in {HD} pathology. {RyR} channels were oxidized, {PKA} phosphorylated and leaky in brain, heart and diaphragm in both {HD} patients and in a murine model of {HD} (Q175). {HD} mice (Q175) with endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) Ca2+ leak exhibited cognitive dysfunction, decreased parasympathetic tone associated with cardiac arrhythmias, and reduced diaphragmatic contractile function resulting in impaired respiratory function. Defects in cognitive, motor and respiratory functions were ameliorated by treatment with a novel Rycal small molecule drug (S107) that fixes leaky {RyR}. Thus, leaky {RyRs} likely play a role in neuronal, cardiac and diaphragmatic pathophysiology in {HD} and identify {RyRs} as a potential novel therapeutic target.}

Manual separation of mutant embryos from wild-type embryos is a tedious and time-consuming task that is prone to errors, especially if there are variable phenotypes of a mutant. Here we describe a zebrafish embryo sorting system with two cameras and image processing based on template-matching algorithms. In order to evaluate the system, zebrafish rx3 mutants that lack eyes due to a patterning defect in brain development were separated from their wild-type siblings. These mutants show glucocorticoid deficiency due to pituitary defects and serve as a model for human secondary adrenal insufficiencies. We show that the variable phenotypes of the mutant embryos can be safely distinguished from phenotypic wild-type zebrafish embryos and sorted from one petri dish into another petri dish or into a 96-well microtiter plate. On average, classification of a zebrafish embryo takes approximately 1 s, with a sensitivity and specificity of 87\% to 95\%, respectively. Other morphological phenotypes may be classified and sorted using similar techniques.}

Larval zebrafish, a vertebrate model, has recently been demonstrated to be amenable to whole brain activity mapping in behaving animals. Here we demonstrate a microfluidic array system ("Fish-Trap") that enables high-throughput mapping of brain-wide activity in awake larval zebrafish. Unlike the commonly practiced larva-processing methods using a rigid gel or a capillary tube, which are laborious and time-consuming, the hydrodynamic design of our microfluidic chip allows automatic, gel-free, and anesthetic-free processing of tens of larvae for microscopic imaging with single-cell resolution. Notably, this system provides the capability to directly couple pharmaceutical stimuli with real-time recording of neural activity in a large number of animals, and the local and global effects of pharmacoactive drugs on the nervous system can be directly visualized and evaluated by analyzing drug-induced functional perturbation within or across different brain regions. Using this technology, we tested a set of neurotoxin peptides and obtained new insights into how to exploit neurotoxin derivatives as therapeutic agents. The novel and versatile "Fish-Trap" technology can be readily unitized to study other stimulus (optical, acoustic, or physical) associated functional brain circuits using similar experimental strategies.}

Here we describe the Zebrafish Entrapment by Restriction Array ({ZEBRA}) device, a microfluidic device that can be used to quickly and repeatably position zebrafish embryos in a predictable array using only a pipette. This technique is well suited for use with automated microscope stages leading to decreased imaging time and increased throughput compared to traditional methods. The addition of access ports above the embryo can be used to administer treatments, and potentially wounding or injections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this device for a neutrophil migration screening application using larvae 3 days post fertilization (dpf) Tg(mpx:dendra2). Larvae were loaded into {ZEBRA} devices and treated with a neutrophil attractant ({LTB4}) or {LTB4} with and without a {PI3K} inhibitor, {LY294002}. Treatment with {LY294002} impaired neutrophil motility into the fin induced by {LTB4} treatment.

The embryonic and larval stages of zebrafish have been used extensively in fundamental and applied research due to advantages offered such as body transparency, small size, low cost of cultivation and high genetic homology with humans. However, the manual experimental methods used for handling and investigating this organism are limited due to their low throughput, labor intensiveness and inaccuracy in delivering external stimuli to the zebrafish while quantifying various neuronal and behavioral responses. Microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices have emerged as ideal technologies to overcome these challenges.

Cancer cells exhibit pronounced iron retention as compared to healthy counterpart. This phenomenon also occurs in multiple myeloma ({MM}), a hematological malignancy characterized by terminally differentiated plasma cells ({PCs}), in which serum ferritin levels have been reported as a negative prognostic marker. The aim of current study is to evaluate the potential role of iron metabolism in promoting drug resistance in myeloma cancer cells with particular regard to the interactions between {PCs} and tumor-associated macrophages ({TAMs}) as a source of iron. Our data showed that myeloma cell lines are able to intake and accumulate iron and thus, increasing their scavenger antioxidant-related genes and mitochondrial mass. We further demonstrated that {PCs} pre-treated with ferric ammonium citrate ({FAC}) decreased bortezomib ({BTZ})-induced apoptosis in vitro and successfully engrafted in zebrafish larvae treated with {BTZ}. Treating human macrophages with {FAC}, we observed a switch toward a M2-like phenotype associated with an increased expression of anti-inflammatory markers such as {ARG1}, suggesting the establishment of an iron-mediated immune suppressive tumor microenvironment favouring myeloma growth. Using mfap4:tomato mutant zebrafish larvae, we further confirmed the increase of {PCs}-monocytes interactions after {FAC} treatment which favour {BTZ}-resistance. Taken together our data support the hypothesis that targeting iron trafficking in myeloma microenvironment may represent a promising strategy to counteract a tumor-supporting milieu and drug resistance.

Estimating a reliable symmetry plane without advanced anatomic knowledge is the most critical challenge. In this work, we developed a new automated method to find the mid-plane in {CT} images of an intact skull and a skull with a unilateral midface fracture. By use of a {3D} point-cloud of a skull, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm could find a mid-plane that meets clinical criteria. There is no need for advanced anatomical knowledge through the use of this algorithm. The algorithm used principal component analysis to find the initial plane. Then the rotation matrix, derived from an iterative closest point ({ICP}) registration method, is used to update the normal vector of the plane and find the optimum symmetry plane. A mathematical index, Hausdorff distance ({HD}), is used to evaluate the similarity of one mid-plane side in comparison to the contralateral side. {HD} decreased by 66\% in the intact skull and 65\% in a fractured skull and converged in just six iterations. High convergence speed, low computational load, and high accuracy suggest the use of the algorithm in the planning procedure. This easy-to-use algorithm with its advantages, as mentioned above, could be used as an operator in craniomaxillofacial software.}

Automatic detection of {MSP} in neuroimages can significantly aid in registration of medical images, asymmetric analysis, and alignment or tilt correction (recenter and reorientation) in brain {MRIs}. The parameters of {MSP} are estimated in two steps. In the first step, symmetric features and principal component analysis ({PCA})-based technique is used to vertically align the bilateral symmetric axis of the brain. In the second step, {PCA} is used to achieve a set of parallel lines (principal axes) from the selected two-dimensional (2-D) elliptical slices of brain {MRIs}, followed by a plane fitting using orthogonal regression. The developed algorithm has been tested on 157 real T1-weighted brain {MRI} datasets including 14 cases from the patients with brain tumors. The presented algorithm is compared with a state-of-the-art approach based on bilateral symmetry maximization. Experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm is fast (\textless1.04 s per {MRI} volume) and exhibits superior performance in terms of accuracy and precision (a mean z-distance of 0.336 voxels and a mean angle difference of 0.06).}

abstract = {Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole insecticide designed to selectively inhibit insect gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) receptors. Although fipronil is often used in or near aquatic environments, few studies have assessed the effects of this neurotoxicant on aquatic vertebrates at sensitive life stages. We explored the toxicological effects of fipronil on embryos and larvae using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) experimental model system. Embryos exposed to fipronil at nominal concentrations at or above 0.7 {microM} (333 mug/l) displayed notochord degeneration, shortening along the rostral-caudal body axis, and ineffective tail flips and uncoordinated muscle contractions along the body axis in response to touch. This phenotype closely resembles zebrafish locomotor mutants of the accordion class and is consistent with loss of reciprocal inhibitory neurotransmission by glycinergic commissural interneurons in the spinal cord. Consistent with the hypothesis that notochord degeneration may be due to abnormal mechanical stress from muscle tetany, the expression patterns of gene and protein markers specific to notochord development were unaffected by fipronil. Moreover, the degenerative effects of fipronil (1.1 {microM}) were reversed by coexposure to the sodium channel blocker {MS}-222 (0.{6mM}). The notochord effects of fipronil were phenocopied by exposure to 70 {microM} strychnine, a glycinergic receptor antagonist. In contrast, exposure to gabazine, a potent vertebrate {GABA}(A) antagonist, resulted in a hyperactive touch response but did not cause notochord degeneration. Although specifically developed to target insect {GABA} receptors with low vertebrate toxicity, our results suggest that fipronil impairs the development of spinal locomotor pathways in fish by inhibiting a structurally related glycine receptor subtype. This represents an unanticipated and potentially novel mechanism for fipronil toxicity in vertebrates.}

abstract = {Abstract The herbicide acetochlor is used in most parts of the world and is frequently detected in agricultural land and surface water; however, knowledge on the neurotoxicity of acetochlor is limited. Here, to test the effects of acetochlor on zebrafish development and behaviour, zebrafish embryos were exposed to acetochlor from 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf, and larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to acetochlor for 24 h. Both were exposed to 5, 10, or 20 mg/L acetochlor. We found that acetochlor induced developmental abnormalities, locomotion variations and changes in the physiology and gene expression in the embryos and larvae. The abnormalities included spinal curvature, brain abnormalities, and the decreased formation of newborn neurons. Larval locomotion was decreased with increases in the absolute turn angle and sinuosity. Acetylcholinesterase activity reduced in both embryos and larvae, and the expression of genes that are involved in neurodevelopment and the neurotransmitter system altered. Acetochlor increased the production of {ROS} and the accumulation of {MDA} but decreased {CAT} activity in the embryonic brain. Additionally, acetochlor induced cell death in the brain and tail spinal cord, and the expression of the apoptosis-related genes Bcl2 and caspase 3 were significantly upregulated. Collectively, this is the first study to examine the molecular and physiological effects of acetochlor on neuronal development, and the potential mechanisms appear to be associated with oxidative stress and decreased {AChE} activity, which disrupt the expression of nervous system genes and apoptosis-related genes and finally lead to apoptosis and morphological malformations.}

abstract = {Zebrafish embryo fluorescent vessel analysis, which aims to automatically investigate the pathogenesis of diseases, has attracted much attention in medical imaging. Zebrafish vessel segmentation is a fairly challenging task, which requires distinguishing foreground and background vessels from the {3D} projection images. Recently, there has been a trend to introduce domain knowledge to deep learning algorithms for handling complex environment segmentation problems with accurate achievements. In this paper, a novel dual deep learning framework called Dual {ResUNet} is developed to conduct zebrafish embryo fluorescent vessel segmentation. To avoid the loss of spatial and identity information, the U-Net model is extended to a dual model with a new residual unit. To achieve stable and robust segmentation performance, our proposed approach merges domain knowledge with a novel contour term and shape constraint. We compare our method qualitatively and quantitatively with several standard segmentation models. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better results than the state-of-art segmentation methods. By investigating the quality of the vessel segmentation, we come to the conclusion that our Dual {ResUNet} model can learn the characteristic features in those cases where fluorescent protein is deficient or blood vessels are overlapped and achieves robust performance in complicated environments.}

abstract = {Vessel segmentation is a critical task for various medical applications, such as diagnosis assistance of diabetic retinopathy, quantification of cerebral aneurysm's growth, and guiding surgery in neurosurgical procedures. Despite technology advances in image segmentation, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy for vessel segmentation in the two challenging while common scenarios in clinical usage: (1) regions with a low signal-to-noise-ratio ({SNR}), and (2) at vessel boundaries disturbed by adjacent non-vessel pixels. In this paper, we present an automated system which can achieve highly accurate vessel segmentation for both {2D} and {3D} images even under these challenging scenarios. Three key contributions achieved by our system are: (1) a progressive contrast enhancement method to adaptively enhance contrast of challenging pixels that were otherwise indistinguishable, (2) a boundary refinement method to effectively improve segmentation accuracy at vessel borders based on Canny edge detection, and (3) a content-aware region-of-interests ({ROI}) adjustment method to automatically determine the locations and sizes of {ROIs} which contain ambiguous pixels and demand further verification. Extensive evaluation of our method is conducted on both {2D} and {3D} datasets. On a public {2D} retinal dataset (named {DRIVE} (Staal 2004 {IEEE} Trans. Med. Imaging 23 501-9)) and our {2D} clinical cerebral dataset, our approach achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods including a vesselness based method (Frangi 1998 Int. Conf. on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention) and an optimally oriented flux ({OOF}) based method (Law and Chung 2008 European Conf. on Computer Vision). An evaluation on 11 clinical {3D} {CTA} cerebral datasets shows that our method can achieve 94\% average accuracy with respect to the manual segmentation reference, which is 23\% to 33\% better than the five baseline methods (Yushkevich 2006 Neuroimage 31 1116-28; Law and Chung 2008 European Conf. on Computer Vision; Law and Chung 2009 {IEEE} Trans.

Experimental results on 10 patients' data, with two {3D} {CT} scans per patient, show that our system's automatic diagnosis outcomes are consistent with clinicians' manual measurements.}

We embrace this idea and generate new architecture that can assign each pixel/voxel in an {MR} image of the brain to its corresponding anatomical region. To benchmark our model, we used the dataset provided by the {IBSR} 2(Internet Brain Segmentation Repository), which consists of 18 manually segmented {MR} images of the brain.

abstract = {Path openings and closings are algebraic morphological operators using families of thin and oriented structuring elements that are not necessarily perfectly straight. These operators can typically be used in filtering applications in lieu of operators based on the more standard families of straight line structuring elements. They yield results which are less constrained than filters based on straight line segments, yet more constrained than connected area or other attribute-based operators. Furthermore, path operators can be parametrised to behave more like either extreme. Natural implementations of this idea using actual suprema or infima of morphological operators with paths as structuring elements would imply exponential complexity. Fortunately, a linear complexity algorithm exists in the literature. This algorithm has similar running times as the best known implementation of morphological operators using straight lines as structuring elements. However, even this implementation is sometimes not fast enough, leading practitioners to favour some attribute-based operators instead, which in some applications is not the best solution. In this paper, we propose an implementation of path-based morphological operators that is shown experimentally to exhibit a logarithmic complexity and comparable computing times with those of attribute-based operators. This implementation has the added benefit of allowing the computation of the related opening transform at no extra computational cost. In order to give additional flexibility and noise-robustness to these operators, we also investigate the case when some pixels are left ignored from the path (i.e. \textquotedblleftjumps\textquotedblright are allowed) and form incomplete paths.}

Further, to reduce the model storage and computational cost, we get a compact model by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on the {MICCAI} 2012 dataset demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms previous methods and has achieved the state-of-the-art performance.

abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Intensity modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}) is commonly employed for treating head and neck (H\&N) cancer with uniform tumor dose and conformal critical organ sparing. Accurate delineation of organs-at-risk ({OARs}) on H\&N {CT} images is thus essential to treatment quality. Manual contouring used in current clinical practice is tedious, time-consuming, and can produce inconsistent results. Existing automated segmentation methods are challenged by the substantial inter-patient anatomical variation and low {CT} soft tissue contrast. To overcome the challenges, we developed a novel automated H\&N {OARs} segmentation method that combines a fully convolutional neural network ({FCNN}) with a shape representation model ({SRM}). {METHODS}: Based on manually segmented H\&N {CT}, the {SRM} and {FCNN} were trained in two steps: (a) {SRM} learned the latent shape representation of H\&N {OARs} from the training dataset; (b) the pre-trained {SRM} with fixed parameters were used to constrain the {FCNN} training. The combined segmentation network was then used to delineate nine {OARs} including the brainstem, optic chiasm, mandible, optical nerves, parotids, and submandibular glands on unseen H\&N {CT} images. Twenty-two and 10 H\&N {CT} scans provided by the Public Domain Database for Computational Anatomy ({PDDCA}) were utilized for training and validation, respectively. Dice similarity coefficient ({DSC}), positive predictive value ({PPV}), sensitivity ({SEN}), average surface distance ({ASD}), and 95\% maximum surface distance (95\%{SD}) were calculated to quantitatively evaluate the segmentation accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed method was compared with an active appearance model that won the 2015 {MICCAI} H\&N Segmentation Grand Challenge based on the same dataset, an atlas method and a deep learning method based on different patient datasets. {RESULTS}: An average {DSC} = 0.870 (brainstem), {DSC} = 0.583 (optic chiasm), {DSC} = 0.937 (mandible), {DSC} = 0.653 (left optic nerve), {DSC} = 0.689 (right optic nerve), {DSC} = 0.835 (left parotid), {DSC} = 0.832 (right parotid), {DSC} = 0.755 (left submandibular), and {DSC} = 0.813 (right submandibular) were achieved. The segmentation results are consistently superior to the results of atlas and statistical shape based methods as well as a patch-wise convolutional neural network method. Once the networks are trained off-line, the average time to segment all 9 {OARs} for an unseen {CT} scan is 9.5 s. {CONCLUSION}: Experiments on clinical datasets of H\&N patients demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed deep neural network segmentation method for multi-organ segmentation on volumetric {CT} scans. The accuracy and robustness of the segmentation were further increased by incorporating shape priors using {SMR}. The proposed method showed competitive performance and took shorter time to segment multiple organs in comparison to state of the art methods. \copyright 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}

abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI}) is widely used in routine clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, variations in {MRI} acquisition protocols result in different appearances of normal and diseased tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}), which have shown to be successful in many medical image analysis tasks, are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging protocols. Therefore, in many cases, networks trained on data acquired with one {MRI} protocol, do not perform satisfactorily on data acquired with different protocols. This limits the use of models trained with large annotated legacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a recurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the following central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image analysis: Given a fitted legacy model, (1) How much data from the new domain is required for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, (2) What portion of the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number of the new domain training samples? To address these questions, we conducted extensive experiments in white matter hyperintensity segmentation task. We trained a {CNN} on legacy {MR} images of brain and evaluated the performance of the domain-adapted network on the same task with images from a different domain. We then compared the performance of the model to the surrogate scenarios where either the same trained network is used or a new network is trained from scratch on the new dataset. The domain-adapted network tuned only by two training examples achieved a Dice score of 0.63 substantially outperforming a similar network trained on the same set of examples from scratch.}

abstract = {{SUMMARY}: Cilia-driven movements of the cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) are involved in zebrafish axis straightness, both in embryos and juveniles [1, 2]. In embryos, axis straightness requires cilia-dependent assembly of the Reissner fiber ({RF}), a {SCO}-spondin polymer running down the brain and spinal cord {CSF}-filled cavities [3]. Reduced expression levels of the urp1 and urp2 genes encoding neuropeptides of the Urotensin {II} family in {CSF}-contacting neurons ({CSF}-{cNs}) also underlie embryonic ventral curvature of several cilia motility mutants [4]. Moreover, mutants for scospondin and uts2r3 (a Urotensin {II} peptide family receptor gene) develop scoliosis at juvenile stages [3, 4]. However, whether {RF} maintenance and {URP} signaling are perturbed in juvenile scoliotic ciliary mutants and how these perturbations are linked to scoliosis is unknown. Here we produced mutants in the zebrafish ortholog of the human {RPGRIP1L} ciliopathy gene encoding a transition zone protein [5–7]. rpgrip1l-/- zebrafish had normal embryogenesis and developed {3D} spine torsions in juveniles. Cilia lining the {CNS} cavities were normal in rpgrip1l-/- embryos but sparse and malformed in juveniles and adults. Hindbrain ventricle dilations were present at scoliosis onset, suggesting defects in {CSF} flow. Immunostaining showed a secondary loss of {RF} correlating with juvenile scoliosis. Surprisingly, transcriptome analysis of rgprip1l mutants at scoliosis onset uncovered increased levels of urp1 and urp2 expression. Overexpressing urp2 in foxj1 -expressing cells triggered scoliosis in rpgrip1l heterozygotes. Thus, our results demonstrate that increased {URP} signaling drives scoliosis onset in a ciliopathy mutant. We propose that imbalanced levels of {URP} neuropeptides in {CSF}-{cNs} may be an initial trigger of scoliosis.}

abstract = {The process of segmenting tumor from {MRI} image of a brain is one of the highly focused areas in the community of medical science as {MRI} is noninvasive imaging. This paper discusses a thorough literature review of recent methods of brain tumor segmentation from brain {MRI} images. It includes the performance and quantitative analysis of state-of-the-art methods. Different methods of image segmentation are briefly explained with the recent contribution of various researchers. Here, an effort is made to open new dimensions for readers to explore the concerned area of research. Through the entire review process, it has been observed that the combination of Conditional Random Field ({CRF}) with Fully Convolutional Neural Network ({FCNN}) and {CRF} with {DeepMedic} or Ensemble are more effective for the segmentation of tumor from the brain {MRI} images.

abstract = {Objective: Deep vein thrombosis ({DVT}) is a disease caused by abnormal blood clots in deep veins. Accurate segmentation of {DVT} is important to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment. In the current study, we proposed a fully automatic method of {DVT} delineation based on deep learning ({DL}) and contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ({CE}-{MRI}) images. Methods: 58 patients (25 males; 28\~96 years old) with newly diagnosed lower extremity {DVT} were recruited. {CE}-{MRI} was acquired on a 1.5 T system. The ground truth ({GT}) of {DVT} lesions was manually contoured. A {DL} network with an encoder-decoder architecture was designed for {DVT} segmentation. 8-Fold cross-validation strategy was applied for training and testing. Dice similarity coefficient ({DSC}) was adopted to evaluate the network's performance. Results: It took about 1.5s for our {CNN} model to perform the segmentation task in a slice of {MRI} image. The mean {DSC} of 58 patients was 0.74± 0.17 and the median {DSC} was 0.79. Compared with other {DL} models, our {CNN} model achieved better performance in {DVT} segmentation (0.74± 0.17 versus 0.66±0.15, 0.55±0.20, and 0.57±0.22). Conclusion: Our proposed {DL} method was effective and fast for fully automatic segmentation of lower extremity {DVT}.}

abstract = {Within the scope of education and training, automatic and accurate segmentation of fractured bones from Computed Tomographic ({CT}) images is the fundamental step in several different applications, such as trauma analysis, visualization, diagnosis, surgical planning and simulation. It helps physicians analyze the severity of injury by taking into account the following fracture features, such as location of the fracture, number of pieces and deviation from the original location. Besides, it helps provide accurate {3D} visualization and decide optimal recovery plans/processes. To accurately segment fracture bones from {CT} images, in the paper, we introduce a segmentation technique that makes labeling process easier. Based on the patient-specific anatomy, unique labels are assigned. Unlike conventional techniques, it also includes the removal of unwanted artifacts, such as flesh. In our experiments, we have demonstrated our concept with real-world data (with an accuracy of 95.45\%) and have compared with state-of-the-art techniques. For validation, our tests followed expert-based decisions i.e., clinical ground-truth. With the results, our collection of 8000 {CT} images will be available upon the request.}

However, most of conducted studies have been dedicated to the effects on gonads, while only few of them were. interested in the effects on the central nervous system which is a known target for estrogenic compounds. In the present study, the effects of estradiol (E2), a natural estrogen, and genistein ({GEN}), a phyto-estrogen, on the brain {ER}-regulated cyp19a1b gene in radial glial cells were investigated alone and in mixtures. For that, zebrafish-specific in vitro and in vivo bioassays were used. In U251-{MG} transactivation assays, E2 and {GEN} produced antagonistic effects at low mixture concentrations. In the cyp19a1b-{GFP} transgenic zebrafish, this antagonism was observed at all ratios and all concentrations of mixtures, confirming the in vitro effects. In the present study, we confirm (i) that our in vitro and in vivo biological models are valuable complementary tools to assess the estrogenic potency of chemicals both alone and in mixtures; (ii) the usefulness of the ray design approach combined with the concentration-addition modeling to highlight interactions between mixture components.}

abstract = {An experiment on line extraction and pattern detection in a photograph is performed. From digitized pictures which have eight gray levels, the value and direction of the steepest descent is first calculated for each point with 3 × 3 meshes. Then those points whose gradient is more than certain threshold value are regarded as component points of line segments. From these points the estimation is done to extend the line portions as far as possible to the neighbouring ones. The pattern detection is done mainly for the photographs of human faces which are in front direction. A standard pattern of a front face is stored in a computer and the correlation values with several sizes of the standard pattern are calculated for the face contour, eyes, nose, and mouth independently. From these correlation values of the face portions, the final determination is done for the existence of a face. This two stage recognition process is adopted because certain portions of a face may be enough for the decision even if the other portion of a face is hidden in noise and could not be detected as such. For many photographs of human faces in several conditions the whole algorithm has been tested with considerable success.}

In order to promote the real-timeliness of image segmentation, this paper introduces the fruitfly optimization algorithm ({FOA}) to {OTSU} segmentation, creating an {FOA}-{OTSU} segmentation algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the optimal threshold for segmentation is searched for by the {FOA}. The classic Lena picture, Flower picture and Cameraman picture were used for simulation experiment, and the results were evaluated by signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) and peak signal-to-noise ratio ({PSNR}). The results show that the segmentation time is reduced by about 50.0\% on the premise of the {PSNR} and {SNR} evaluation criteria and the segmentation effect basically unchanged. The simulations indicate that our method converges faster and consumes fewer time than traditional {OTSU} algorithm, without sacrificing the segmentation accuracy. The research provides a desirable tool with high real-time performance of rapid image segmentation.}

abstract = {The liver is considered as one of the complicated organs in human body. It has close proximity to the neighboring organs in abdomen with numerous anatomical variations. It is difficult to find out the severity of disease connected to the liver unless the scanned image is subjected to segmentation process. The difficulty level also varies with the diseases that affect the liver. Any of the disease alters its density, homogeneity, color and texture. Liver image segmentation is necessary to identify the complexity and severity of the disease and it remains as an open challenge to researchers. Among all liver segmentation algorithms, threshold segmentation is fastest, simplest and numerically less complex. The accuracy of threshold-based segmentation lies in the selection of threshold values which separates foreground and background. This paper proposes a novel multi-threshold liver segmentation model based on {\textquotedblleftSlope} Difference Distribution\textquotedblright ({SDD}) of image histogram. It consists of three stages. In the first stage, the noise in Computed Tomography ({CT}) scan image is reduced using a median filter. In the second stage, automatic threshold values are obtained from {SDD} of image histogram. These threshold values separate the liver image accurately from abdominal {CT} scan image. In the third stage, seed points are selected automatically which grow outwardly using the Fast Marching Method ({FMM}) discovering liver border in {CT} scan image. The proposed model is tested on 55 {CT} scan images and it is providing satisfactory results.}

Hence, computer-aided diagnosis of glaucoma was proposed to assist ophthalmologist to conduct a fast and accurate glaucoma screening. One of the ocular examination in screening is optic nerve examination called disc damage likelihood scale ({DDLS}). It is important to find the optic disc and the optic cup to determine the narrowest width of the neuroretinal rim when using {DDLS}. To find the optic cup, this study proposed a segmentation scheme consisting of pre-process, segmentation, convex hull and morphological opening operation. In pre-process the blood vessel was removed to make the segmentation process of the optic cup easier. The segmentation process was done by using an adaptive thresholding followed by morphological image processing such as convex hull, opening and erosion. This algorithm was applied on Magrabia dataset and attained accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 99.50\%, 99.75\% and 75.19\% respectively.}

abstract = {The global increase in population has simultaneously raised the awareness to maintain good health in most of the people. The poor quality of food taken and environmental pollution leads to occurrence of lung cancer in most of the people. It is highly important to detect the lung cancer in earlier stages with minimum time delay and provide a better solution to reduce the lung cancer. Early detection of lung cancer is also desirable for efficient analysis and it helps ophthalmologist to provide the treatment in early stages. Earlier researchers employed methods like Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}) for image enhancement, thresholding approach for segmentation and Binarization approach for Extraction etc.,. Research work aiming at computerizing these selections, passing the available lung cancer images and its database in basic three stages like enhancement, segmentation and feature Extraction stage to achieve more quality and accuracy in detection of lung cancer. Approaches developed by the earlier researchers fail to produce accuracy in real time applications. Hence, to overcome the drawbacks of these approaches a new method to detect lung cancer using Gabor filters and watershed segmentation techniques is proposed in this work. The {CT} (Computed Tomography) images captured from lung cancer patients are analyzed by developing Digital Image processing technique. The results obtained are comparable with standard values obtained from the hospital for real time analysis. Hence, this new technique with Gabor filters and watershed segmentation approach can be used for quick detection of lung cancer. This approach is beneficial to the Medical Equipment's manufacturing industries and also helps the medical practitioners for early detection of lung cancer.},

abstract = {The traditional watershed algorithm has the limitation of false mark in medical image segmentation, which causes over-segmentation and images to be contaminated by noise possibly during acquisition. In this study, we proposed an improved watershed segmentation algorithm based on morphological processing and total variation model ({TV}) for medical image segmentation. First of all, morphological gradient preprocessing is performed on {MRI} images of brain lesions. Secondly, the gradient images are denoised by the all-variational model. While retaining the edge information of {MRI} images of brain lesions, the image noise is reduced. And then, the internal and external markers are obtained by forced minimum technique, and the gradient amplitude images are corrected by using these markers. Finally, the modified gradient image is subjected to watershed transformation. The experiment of segmentation and simulation of brain lesion {MRI} image is carried out on {MATLAB}. And the segmentation results are compared with other watershed algrothims. The experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains the least number of regions, which can extract {MRI} images of brain lesions effectively. In addition, this method can inhibit over-segmentation, improving the segmentation results of lesions in {MRI} images of brain lesions.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {OBJECTIVE}: Skin lesion segmentation is an important but challenging task in computer-aided diagnosis of dermoscopy images. Many segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks often fail to extract accurate lesion boundaries because the spatial size of feature maps decreases as the maps are processed throughout the network layers. We propose skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopy images based on a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism, which can preserve edge details. {METHODS}: We devised a high-resolution feature block containing three branches, namely, main, spatial attention, and channel-wise attention branches. The main branch takes high-resolution feature maps as input to extract spatial details around boundaries. The other two attention branches boost the discriminative features in the main branch regarding the spatial and channel-wise dimensions. By fusing the branch outputs, robust features with detailed spatial information can be extracted, and accurate skin lesion boundaries can be obtained. {RESULTS}: Experiments on datasets from the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging in 2016 and 2017 and the {PH2} dataset retrieved Jaccard indices of 0.783, 0.858, and 0.857, respectively, for the proposed method. Hence, our method can accurately extract skin lesion boundaries and is robust to hair fibers and artifacts in the images. Overall, our method outperforms two typical segmentation networks ({FCN}-8 s and U-Net) and other state-of-the-art skin lesion segmentation methods. {CONCLUSIONS}: The proposed network endowed with high-resolution feature blocks preserves spatial details during feature extraction, and its attention mechanism enhances representative features while suppressing noise. Hence, the proposed approach provides high-performance skin lesion segmentation. Copyright \copyright 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.}

abstract = {Fetal echocardiography ({FE}) is a widely used medical examination for early diagnosis of congenital heart disease ({CHD}). The apical four-chamber view ({A4C}) is an important view among early {FE} images. Accurate segmentation of crucial anatomical structures in the {A4C} view is a useful and important step for early diagnosis and timely treatment of {CHDs}. However, it is a challenging task due to several unfavorable factors: (a) artifacts and speckle noise produced by ultrasound imaging. (b) category confusion caused by the similarity of anatomical structures and variations of scanning angles. (c) missing boundaries. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end {DW}-Net for accurate segmentation of seven important anatomical structures in the {A4C} view. The network comprises two components: 1) a Dilated Convolutional Chain ({DCC}) for "gridding issue" reduction, multi-scale contextual information aggregation and accurate localization of cardiac chambers. 2) a W-Net for gaining more precise boundaries and yielding refined segmentation results. Extensive experiments of the proposed method on a dataset of 895 {A4C} views have demonstrated that {DW}-Net can achieve good segmentation results, including the Dice Similarity Coefficient ({DSC}) of 0.827, the Pixel Accuracy ({PA}) of 0.933, the {AUC} of 0.990 and it substantially outperformed some well-known segmentation methods. Our work was highly valued by experienced clinicians. The accurate and automatic segmentation of the {A4C} view using the proposed {DW}-Net can benefit further extractions of useful clinical indicators in early {FE} and improve the prenatal diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of {CHDs}.

abstract = {Understanding plant growth processes is important for many aspects of biology and food security. Automating the observations of plant development-a process referred to as plant phenotyping-is increasingly important in the plant sciences, and is often a bottleneck. Automated tools are required to analyze the data in microscopy images depicting plant growth, either locating or counting regions of cellular features in images. In this paper, we present to the plant community an introduction to and exploration of two machine learning approaches to address the problem of marker localization in confocal microscopy. First, a comparative study is conducted on the classification accuracy of common conventional machine learning algorithms, as a means to highlight challenges with these methods. Second, a {3D} (volumetric) deep learning approach is developed and presented, including consideration of appropriate loss functions and training data. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of all the results produced is performed. Evaluation of all approaches is performed on an unseen time-series sequence comprising several individual {3D} volumes, capturing plant growth. The comparative analysis shows that the deep learning approach produces more accurate and robust results than traditional machine learning. To accompany the paper, we are releasing the {4D} point annotation tool used to generate the annotations, in the form of a plugin for the popular {ImageJ} ({FIJI}) software.

Demonstrating this, we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control ({AUC} = 0.99).

abstract = {Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to automatically segment and quantify cell-types in images acquired from both confocal and light sheet fluorescence microscopy. However, the training of deep learning networks requires a massive amount of manually-labeled training data, which is a very time-consuming operation. In this paper, we demonstrate an adversarial adaptation method to transfer deep network knowledge for microscopy segmentation from one imaging modality (e.g., confocal) to a new imaging modality (e.g., light sheet) for which no or very limited labeled training data is available. Promising segmentation results show that the proposed transfer learning approach is an effective way to rapidly develop segmentation solutions for new imaging methods.}

abstract = {Segmentation and detection of mitotic nuclei is a challenging task. To address this problem, a Transfer Learning based fast and accurate system is proposed. To give the classifier a balanced dataset, this work exploits the concept of Transfer Learning by first using a pre-trained convolutional neural network ({CNN}) for segmentation, and then another Hybrid-{CNN} (with Weights Transfer and custom layers) for classification of mitoses. First, mitotic nuclei are automatically annotated, based on the ground truth centroids. The segmentation module then segments mitotic nuclei and also produces some false positives. Finally, the detection module is trained on the patches from the segmentation module and performs the final detection. Fine-tuning based Transfer Learning reduced training time, provided good initial weights, and improved the detection rate with F-measure of 0.713 and 76\% area under the precision-recall curve for the challenging task of mitosis detection. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

Fundus images are generally degraded by noise and suffer from low contrast issues. These issues make it difficult for ophthalmologist to detect and interpret diseases in fundus images. This paper presents a noise removal and contrast enhancement algorithm for fundus image. Integration of filters and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization ({CLAHE}) technique is applied for solving the issues of de-noising and enhancement of color fundus image. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated through different performance parameters like Peak Signal to Noise Ratio ({PSNR}), Structural Similarity Index ({\SSIM}), Correlation coefficient ({CoC}) and Edge preservation index ({EPI}). The proposed method achieved 7.85\% improvement in {PSNR}, 1.19\% improvement in {\SSIM}, 0.12\% improvement in {CoC} and 1.28\% improvement in {EPI} when compared to the state of the art method.}

For the periapical readings they graded the quality of the examination with regard to visually locating the root apex. For the bitewing readings they registered all occurrences of approximal caries on a confidence scale. Each reading was first done on an unprocessed radiograph ("single-view"), and then re-done with the image processed with {SWAHE} displayed beside the unprocessed version ("twin-view"). The processing parameters for {SWAHE} were the same for all the images. {RESULTS}: For the periapical examinations, twin-view was judged to raise the image quality for 52\% of those cases where the single-view quality was below the maximum. For the bitewing radiographs, there was a change of caries classification (both positive and negative) with twin-view in 19\% of the cases, but with only a 3\% net increase in the total number of caries registrations. For both examinations interobserver variance was unaffected. {CONCLUSIONS}: Non-interactive {SWAHE} applied to dental {SP} radiographs produces a supplemental contrast enhanced image which in twin-view reading improves the image quality of periapical examinations. {SWAHE} also affects caries diagnosis of bitewing images, and further study using a gold standard is warranted.}

The contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization ({CLAHE}) algorithm was deepened fruit green region and improve edge definition in image, and then the R-B color difference image based on {CLAHE} image was obtained. The linear contrast of the original {RGB} image was enhanced to improve color difference in the normal light regions of fruits and leaves. The image after contrast enhancement was extracted in the region of R-B color difference image. Then the image was performed with {OTSU} segmentation algorithm and denoising to extract the normal light region of fruit. For the extraction of highlighted region of fruit in {RGB} images of bagged green apples, the main colors of image were first extracted. Then, the image was reconstructed with the main colors. The reconstructed and original images were subtracted and denoised to realize the extraction of the highlighted region of fruits. Finally, the complete fruit target region was obtained by combining the two extracted regions. The test results showed that we could obtain more complete fruit region of bagged green fruits based on the method in the work.}

As a prerequisite for further processing and analysis of the obtained microscopic images, a new method is presented for correcting this attenuation. The correction is based on beam modelling and on a differential form of the modified Beer-Lambert law. It turns out that the intensity decay can be modelled as a double convolution of the microscopic image with the intensities of the excitation semibeam and the emission beam. Under weak assumptions made for the intensities of the fluorescent radiation and the detected signal, formulas for the attenuation correction and the attenuation simulation are derived. The method traces back to that one published by Roerdink which is modified concerning a more realistic beam modelling, avoiding the so-called weak attenuation expansion and considering fluorescence excitation throughout the light cone of the excitation beam. The applicability of the method is demonstrated for synthetic examples as well as microscopic images of chromatographic beads. It is shown that the new method can be successfully applied for reconstructing the true fluorophore distribution in specimens even if the microscopic images are affected by strong attenuation. {LAY} {DESCRIPTION}: The applicability of confocal laser scanning microscopy is limited by attenuation of the excitation and the fluorescence emission beam.

abstract = {Light sheet fluorescence microscopy ({LSFM}) is rapidly becoming an essential technology for mesoscopic imaging of samples such as embryos and adult mouse organs. However, {LSFM} can suffer from optical artifacts for which there is no intrinsic solution. The attenuation of light due to absorbing material causes "shadow" artifacts along both the illumination and detection paths. Several approaches have been introduced to reduce this problem, including scanning illumination and multi-view imaging. However, neither of these approaches completely eliminates the problem. If the distribution of the absorbing material is complex, shadows cannot be avoided. We introduce a new approach that relies on multi-modal integration of two very different mesoscopic techniques. Unlike {LSFM}, optical projection tomography ({OPT}) can operate in transmission mode to create a voxel map of the {3D} distribution of the sample's optical attenuation. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid instrument ({OPTiSPIM}) that can quantify this attenuation and use the information to correct the shadow artifacts of {LSFM}.}

We use a Bayesian optimality criterion, the maximum of the posterior probability distribution, and computationally efficiently fit Beer's Law to the {3D} intensity data collected from thick living biofilms by a confocal scanning laser microscope. Using this approach the top surface of the biofilm and an optimal image threshold can be estimated. Biofilm characteristics, such as bio-volumes, can be calculated from this surface. Results from the Bayesian approach are compared to other approaches including the method of maximum likelihood or simply counting bright pixels. Uncertainty quantification (i.e., error bars) can be provided for the parameters of interest. This approach is applied to confocal images of stained biofilms of a common lab strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, stained biofilms of Janthinobacterium isolated from the Antarctic, and biofilms of Staphylococcusaureus that have been genetically modified to fluoresce green.

abstract = {Differences in growth rates between Eucalyptus clones depend on differences in the acquisition of resources, and the efficiency of using resources to produce carbohydrates and grow wood. We examined differences in canopy structure, light interception, and light use efficiency for the 18 {TECHS} clones in a common garden experiment in Brazil. The degree of clumping within canopies varied substantially among clones, leading to large differences in both leaf area and light interception per unit of leaf area. Two methods of determining plot-level leaf area index ({LP}-80 and {LAI}-2000) were moderately well correlated ({R2R2} = 0.4), but both methods underestimated actual leaf area index (determined by destructive sampling) by about one-third. Completely overcast sky conditions increased accuracy of leaf area estimates, reducing variation among measurements within plots and lowering the number of samples needed to obtain a given level of precision. Genotypes with high leaf area clumping also had higher leaf angle inclinations than genotypes with lower clumping. The apparent light interception coefficient (kk) averaged 0.56 for the {LP}-80, and 0.47 for the {LAI}-2000. The range of kk estimates differed by up to 2-fold among clones, underscoring the limited generality of light extinction coefficients. Light interception ranged from about 70 to 95\% of incoming light, and leaf area index accounted for only 30\% of the pattern in light interception among clones. Differences in stemwood production were influenced more strongly by clonal differences in efficiency of light use (stemwood production per unit of light intercepted) than by differences in leaf area or light interception. The efficiency of producing wood per unit of light intercepted spanned a two-fold range, with higher efficiencies for more productive clones. We suggest that production ecology studies focus more on measurements of light interception than on leaf area, avoiding issues about difficult-to-measure features of crown and canopy structures. The additional step of characterizing light use efficiency would also be very important.}

Light interception and utilization depend not only on canopy N distribution but also on leaf N allocation in the thylakoid light-harvesting proteins (membrane proteins) and Rubisco (water-soluble proteins). However, the distribution of different forms of N in the canopy and its relationship with canopy light and N distribution have not yet been clarified. In this study, two Brassica napus L. cultivars, Zhongyouza R5 (R5) and Huayouza No. 9 (H9), were grown under four N levels in a two-year field experiment to provide some insight into the coordination between light and N distribution in the canopy. The results showed that R5 absorbed the equivalent N and produced higher shoot biomass than H9, thereby improving the {NUtE}. Compared with H9, R5 had a lower light extinction coefficient ({KL}) and a higher N extinction coefficient ({KN}), thereby its light and N coordination parameter ({KN}/{KL}) being greater in both growing seasons. The fraction of {SDS} (sodium dodecyl sulfate; a detergent) soluble proteins associated with membrane proteins in R5 was 40.4 \% lower than H9. Through a d-separation method of path analysis, {KL} and {KN} could be simultaneously improved by reducing {SDS}-soluble proteins N or increasing the extinction coefficient of water-soluble proteins N. This suggests that optimizing leaf N allocation could improve canopy light and N distribution, thereby enhancing canopy carbon gain and {NUtE}.}

Exposure to environmental pollutants during embryonic development is particularly risky. Although many pollutants have been verified as potential toxicants, there are new chemicals in the environment that need assessment. Heart development is an extremely sensitive process, which can be affected by environmentally toxic molecule exposure during embryonic development. Congenital heart defects are the most common life-threatening global health problems, and the etiology is mostly unknown. The zebrafish has emerged as an invaluable model to examine substance toxicity on vertebrate development, particularly on cardiac development. The zebrafish offers numerous advantages for toxicology research not found in other model systems. Many laboratories have used the zebrafish to study the effects of widespread chemicals in the environment on heart development, including pesticides, nanoparticles, and various organic pollutants. Here, we review the uses of the zebrafish in examining effects of exposure to external molecules during embryonic development in causing cardiac defects, including chemicals ubiquitous in the environment and illicit drugs. Known or potential mechanisms of toxicity and how zebrafish research can be used to provide mechanistic understanding of cardiac defects are discussed.}

With the help of modern genetics and a sequenced genome, zebrafish have led to insights in cardiovascular diseases ranging from {CHDs} to arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy. Here, we discuss the utility of zebrafish as a model system and summarize zebrafish cardiac morphogenesis with emphasis on parallels to human heart diseases. Additionally, we discuss the specific tools and experimental platforms utilized in the zebrafish model including forward screens, functional characterization of candidate genes, and high throughput applications.}

abstract = {Most neurodegenerative diseases are currently incurable, with large social and economic impacts. Recently, there has been renewed interest in investigating natural products in the modern drug discovery paradigm as novel, bioactive small molecules. Moreover, the discovery of potential therapies for neurological disorders is challenging and involves developing optimized animal models for drug screening. In contemporary biomedicine, the growing need to develop experimental models to obtain a detailed understanding of malady conditions and to portray pioneering treatments has resulted in the application of zebrafish to close the gap between in vitro and in vivo assays. Zebrafish in pharmacogenetics and neuropharmacology are rapidly becoming a widely used organism. Brain function, dysfunction, genetic, and pharmacological modulation considerations are enhanced by both larval and adult zebrafish. Bioassay-guided identification of natural products using zebrafish presents as an attractive strategy for generating new lead compounds. Here, we see evidence that the zebrafish's central nervous system is suitable for modeling human neurological disease and we review and evaluate natural product research using zebrafish as a vertebrate model platform to systematically identify bioactive natural products. Finally, we review recently developed zebrafish models of neurological disorders that have the potential to be applied in this field of research.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Exposure to the commonly used dithiocarbamate ({DTC}) pesticides is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson disease ({PD}), although the mechanisms by which they exert their toxicity are not completely understood. {OBJECTIVE}: We studied the mechanisms of ziram's (a {DTC} fungicide) neurotoxicity in vivo. {METHODS}: Zebrafish ({ZF}) embryos were utilized to determine ziram's effects on behavior, neuronal toxicity, and the role of synuclein in its toxicity. {RESULTS}: Nanomolar-range concentrations of ziram caused selective loss of dopaminergic ({DA}) neurons and impaired swimming behavior. Because ziram increases \alpha-synuclein (\alpha-syn) concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of ziram on {ZF} \gamma-synuclein 1 (\gamma1). {ZF} express 3 synuclein isoforms, and {ZF} \gamma1 appears to be the closest functional homologue to \alpha-syn. We found that recombinant {ZF} \gamma1 formed fibrils in vitro, and overexpression of {ZF} \gamma1 in {ZF} embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity in a manner similar to that of \alpha-syn. Importantly, knockdown of {ZF} \gamma1 with morpholinos and disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer {CLR01} prevented ziram's {DA} toxicity. {CONCLUSIONS}: These data show that ziram is selectively toxic to {DA} neurons in vivo, and this toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms by which pesticides may cause {PD}.

abstract = {Understanding mechanisms mediating tumor metastasis is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting. Here, we take advantage of a transparent embryonic zebrafish xenograft model ({eZXM}) to visualize and track metastatic cells in real time using selective plane illumination microscopy ({SPIM}) for up to 30 h. Injected human leukemic and breast cancer cells exhibited cell-type specific patterns of intravascular distribution with leukemic cells moving faster than breast cancer cells. Tracking of tumor cells from high-resolution images revealed acute differences in intravascular speed and distance covered by cells. While the majority of injected breast cancer cells predominantly adhered to nearby vasculature, about 30\% invaded the non-vascularized tissue, reminiscent of their metastatic phenotype. Survival of the injected tumor cells appeared to be partially inhibited and time-lapse imaging showed a possible role for host macrophages of the recipient embryos. Leukemic cell dissemination could be effectively blocked by pharmacological {ROCK1} inhibition using Fasudil. These observations, and the ability to image several embryos simultaneously, support the use of {eZXM} and {SPIM} imaging as a functional screening platform to identify compounds that suppress cancer cell spread and invasion.}

abstract = {Despite widespread drug exposure, for example during gestation or in prematurely born children, organ-specific developmental toxicity of most drugs is poorly understood. Developmental and functional abnormalities are a major cause of kidney diseases during childhood; however, the potential causal relationship to exposure with nephrotoxic drugs during nephrogenesis is widely unknown. To identify developmental nephrotoxic drugs in a large scale, we established and performed an automated high-content screen to score for phenotypic renal alterations in the Tg(wt1b:{EGFP}) zebrafish line. During early nephrogenesis, embryos were exposed to a compound library of approved drugs. After treatment, embryos were aligned within microtiter plates using {3D}-printed orientation tools enabling the robust acquisition of consistent dorsal views of pronephric kidneys by automated microscopy. To qualitatively and quantitatively score and visualize phenotypes, we developed software tools for the semi-automated analysis, processing and visualization of this large image-based dataset. Using this scoring scheme, we were able to categorize compounds based on their potential developmental nephrotoxic effects. About 10\% of tested drugs induced pronephric phenotypes including glomerular and tubular malformations, or overall changes in kidney morphology. Major chemical compound groups identified to cause glomerular and tubular alterations included dihydropyridine derivatives, {HMG} {CoA} reductase inhibitors, fibrates, imidazole, benzimidazole and triazole derivatives, corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, acetic acid derivatives and propionic acid derivatives. In conclusion, the presented study demonstrates the large-scale screening of kidney-specific toxicity of approved drugs in a live vertebrate embryo. The associated technology and tool-sets can be easily adapted for other organ systems providing a unique platform for in vivo large-scale assessment of organ-specific developmental toxicity or other biomedical applications. Ultimately, the presented data and associated visualization and browsing tools provide a resource for potentially nephrotoxic drugs and for further investigations.

abstract = {Automated high-throughput workflows allow for chemical toxicity testing and drug discovery in zebrafish disease models. Due to its conserved structural and functional properties, the zebrafish pronephros offers a unique model to study renal development and disease at larger scale. Ideally, scoring of pronephric phenotypes includes morphological and functional assessments within the same larva. However, to efficiently upscale such assays, refinement of existing methods is required. Here, we describe the development of a multiparametric in vivo screening pipeline for parallel assessment of pronephric morphology, kidney function and heart rate within the same larva on a single imaging platform. To this end, we developed a novel {3D}-printed orientation tool enabling multiple consistent orientations of larvae in agarose-filled microplates. Dorsal pronephros imaging was followed by assessing renal clearance and heart rates upon fluorescein isothiocyanate ({FITC})-inulin microinjection using automated time-lapse imaging of laterally positioned larvae. The pipeline was benchmarked using a set of drugs known to induce developmental nephrotoxicity in humans and zebrafish. Drug-induced reductions in renal clearance and heart rate alterations were detected even in larvae exhibiting minor pronephric phenotypes. In conclusion, the developed workflow enables rapid and semi-automated in vivo assessment of multiple morphological and functional parameters.}

abstract = {The zebrafish is being increasingly used in biomedical research and drug discovery to conduct large-scale compound screening. However, there is a lack of accessible methodologies to enable automated imaging and scoring of tissue-specific phenotypes at enhanced resolution. Here, we present the development of an automated imaging pipeline to identify chemical modifiers of glomerular cyst formation in a zebrafish model for human cystic kidney disease. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein Ift172 in Tg(wt1b:{EGFP}) embryos was used to induce large glomerular cysts representing a robustly scorable phenotypic readout. Compound-treated embryos were consistently aligned within the cavities of agarose-filled microplates. By interfacing feature detection algorithms with automated microscopy, a smart imaging workflow for detection, centring and zooming in on regions of interests was established, which enabled the automated capturing of standardised higher resolution datasets of pronephric areas. High-content screening datasets were processed and analysed using custom-developed heuristic algorithms implemented in common open-source image analysis software. The workflow enables highly efficient profiling of entire compound libraries and scoring of kidney-specific morphological phenotypes in thousands of zebrafish embryos. The demonstrated toolset covers all the aspects of a complex whole organism screening assay and can be adapted to other organs, specimens or applications.}

However, sample handling and conservation of sample integrity during lengthy staining and acquisition protocols remains a challenge. This study overcomes these challenges with acrylamide hydrogels synthesised to match the refractive index of solutions typically utilised in aqueous tissue clearing protocols. These hydrogels have a high-water content (82.0±3.7\% by weight). The gels are stable over time and {FITC}-{IgG} readily permeated into, and effluxed out of them. Whilst the gels deformed and/or swelled over time in some commonly used solutions, this was overcome by using a previously described custom {RIMS} solution. To validate their use, {CUBIC} cleared mouse tissues and whole embryos were embedded in hydrogels, stained using fluorescent small molecule dyes, labels and antibodies and successfully imaged using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, the high-water content, high refractive index hydrogels described in this study have a broad applicability to research that delves into pathophysiological processes by stabilisating and protecting large and fragile samples.}

abstract = {Tissue clearing methods have boosted the microscopic observations of thick samples such as whole-mount mouse or zebrafish. Even with the best tissue clearing methods, specimens are not completely transparent and light attenuation increases with depth, reducing signal output and signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, since tissue clearing and microscopic acquisition techniques have become faster, automated image analysis is now an issue. In this context, mounting specimens at large scale often leads to imperfectly aligned or oriented samples, which makes relying on predefined, sample-independent parameters to correct signal attenuation impossible. Here, we propose a sample-dependent method for contrast correction. It relies on segmenting the sample, and estimating sample depth isosurfaces that serve as reference for the correction. We segment the brain white matter of zebrafish larvae. We show that this correction allows a better stitching of opposite sides of each larva, in order to image the entire larva with a high signal-to-noise ratio throughout. We also show that our proposed contrast correction method makes it possible to better recognize the deep structures of the brain by comparing manual vs. automated segmentations. This is expected to improve image observations and analyses in high-content methods where signal loss in the samples is significant.}
